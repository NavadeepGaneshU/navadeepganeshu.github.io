	<h1>Hi there, I'm Ayoub!</h1>
	<p>I'm a young gradute at Polytech Sorbonne in Paris, specialized in the field of Embedded Systems.
	I'm italian with moroccan roots and I have been living in France for five years now. I see myself as the result
	of mixing several cultures.
	</p>

	<p>I'm very passionated about technology and innovation, especially in the domains of electronics and computer science.
	This is one of the reasons that lead me to choose embedded systems as a major for my studies, since it combines these
	two fields blending hardware and software. During my studies and school projects I have discovered that I really enjoy
	low-level programming: it's funny to go deeper into processors architectures and build designs from scratch.
	</p>

	<p>During my internships I've had the opportunity to work in the field of IoT, developing custom IoT solutions for agriculture.
  During my last experience at STMicroelectronics, I've even joined a team which develop and maintain a C-written middleware that permits
	STM32 microcontrollers to send and receive data through cellular networks (such as NB-IoT, LTE Cat. M, GPRS, ...).
	</p>

	<p>These experiences gave me a deeper understanding of this technology, the benefits brought by it and taught me
	the methodology for the design process. IoT systems may appear simpler than others; this is partly true because
	often we don't have real-time costraints, but the architecture still remains complex needing skills on both low level (bare-metal development) and high level layers (OSI model).
	You can find more details about my work experience <a href="/resume">here</a>.
	</p>

	<p>In my free time I try to learn new stuff that can be useful to me in the future, take photos and (obviously) watch tv shows.
	I will probably add a section to my portfolio so that I can showcase some of my shoots in the future.
	Recently I have started working on some open-source projects. I find the concept of a community sharing their code
	very interesting and I'm delighted to contribute when I can.
	</p>

	<p>I <em>love</em> football (or soccer, call it whatever you want). I started to play at very young age and even if
	currently I'm not part of any team I still enjoy a good match from time to time.
