	<h1>Hi there, I'm Navadeep!</h1>
	<p>
	I'm currently an Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.msruas.ac.in/">Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences</a>, Bengaluru.
	</p>

	<p>I'm passionate about technology and research with major interests in Embedded Systems, Circuit Design, Analog and Power Electronics. Applying these, I like designing, 
	prototyping devices and realize technology and its applications through this. Occasionally, RF and Quantum stuffs fascinate me (yes, the Starlink, 6G and CERN).
	</p>

	<p> After taking an undergraduate course in Electrical Engineering, with the curiosity to explore areas and work hands-on, during my first year I worked as a Hardware IoT intern with an AgriTech startup for devising agricultural field sensor nodes. Then, as a research
	intern at the Centre for Energy, IIT Guwahati where I worked on electrical load data modelling and prediction for exploring ways to optimize energy generation and utilization. I am interested
	to work in an environment having a mix of research and implementation factor around ideas. Currently, I am working as an Embedded Hardware intern with a CleanTech startup for developing technological solutions to help restore the air around us.
	</p>

	<p>I strongly believe in open-source culture and have the motive of making technology more easily and affordably expand. I enjoy being a part of technical
	communities and societies and an active member at <a href="https://www.element14.com/community/welcome"> Element14 </a> and <a href="https://www.hackster.io"> Hackster </a> where I involve in building theme projects, design challenges, discussions and RoadTest program through which I get to work hands-on
	with electronic evaluation kits and experiment around discrete components.
	</p>
	
	<p>I write blogs related to technology and application projects at <a href="https://www.clevertronics.blogspot.com/"> CL3VERTRONICS-spark something!</a>
	   Info: I am compiling a list of go-to resources related to Electrical/Electronics for anyone to get started, learn and design <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F6QD4pwdFm0BHOtuB9GgOoCscusBkHyD78baEDBf7_U/edit?usp=sharing"> EE_Resources_Chart_V0 </a> (its still in drafty stage and contributions are appreciated!)

	   Feel free to connect/drop me a message. I'd love to interact, collaborate and contribute!
