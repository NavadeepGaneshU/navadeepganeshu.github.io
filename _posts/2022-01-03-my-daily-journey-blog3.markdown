<p><i>5th November 2022</i></p>

<p>This is the second movie I am writing about here. "The Intern" - amazing movie with lessons in each scene. Push the boundaries. Be up for any type of  work. Move ahead of expectations. Know about people with you - be at work or a trip or amywhere. Show kindness, behave gentle and be consistent in actions. Take situational opportunities, may seem wrong - but if it gives an opportunity to explore or understand soemthing, its certainly right.</p>

<p><i>1st November 2022</i></p>

<p>Amazing day with unexpected incidents. Was casually riding in a cycle(probably little too fast) and slightly hit a scooter which was turning around in middle of the road. No any hard impacts or injury - but the scooter driver yelled at me. Me thinking its a minor hit to edge of the mudguard just kept moving also because there were vehicles behind in a narrow road and I cringed to stop at that moment somehow.... fast forward, I crossed the traffic signal and a guy is pulling my shirt asking to stop!!! As I stopped the cycle and turned around, there come a bang! bang! and again. I was hit by 2 boys right on my face and lips started bleeding.  Well, I totally apologized and after seeing my lips, he offered me a juice in nearby shop and let go. I may not have damaged the scooter - even a minor scratch, but the person's ego as he yelled at me and I was just moving - my bad :( </p>

<p>Its easy to make mistake, an error, an accident or anything wrong. The consequence is that you may hurt yourself, someone in the front physically or mentally. One thing I understood is that at any of these instances, drop your ego, respect and just come down, pause for a moment, apologize, understand the cause and how to avoid it before moving on. This may take the situation long way better.</p>

<p><i>30th August 2022</i></p>

<p>Did a dumb job? Things didn't work as it has to? Hung up in a totally irrelevant situation? and many more happenes every day.... One thing that can help out here is to hold yourself straight up - be confident to justify what your're doing and what has happened - apologise as we take wrong turns many turns - let not anyone judge you or don't mind if that happens. Speaking up about it confidently brought myself out of these situations and helped fix it many times. But yes, its not easy to speak up or justify all the time. Get into many such situations, realize you're in it(never sleepwalk with situations) self enhance and over time its all ok! </p>

<p>Had this situation today - sometimes you may not get what you are supposed to get and you're disappointed. Logically you're supposed to have it(and others who are in your place have it). These always keep happening and me an introvert try to find excuses myself and keep shut most of the times. I mostly never quarreled or encountered such situation in high and just got silent thinking its all fine! Maybe sometime its the best solution - like you can't go and argue always, but softly doing it, telling your issue and justfifcation with your stance is really necessary I feel now. So once I did this softly and it didn't work out immediately. Eventually maybe multipe people raised similar arguements, but it worked out today and I am getting what I need. I can understand it is not from my speakup alone, but a collective voice and the management has taken this decision. So you may never know what's happening in the backend - just raise the voice if you think you're not given equality/importance or whatsoever you think is supposed to and leave rest for the environment to work out!</p>

<p><i>28th August 2022</i></p>

<p>Think for a moment before you talk or approach a problem. Getting into and thinking may be inefficient or unnecessary things may slip in. Some people may be good at both, but I just run into a feedback loop "Damn! I am stuck and what will people think if I don't answer/approach this rightly and mind stalls"....</p>

<p>Take pauses while speaking to think if you're going ok! Go to other person's stand and view what you have just said. If you don't know - its ok to take a pause again, think and tackle the situation. Don't overthink what may be going on other people's mind and how bad/good they may be thinking about you.</p>

<p>Sometimes people may think you're crazy if you're too confident or too nervous or too fast in speaking. Do not exaggerate or include unreal stuff in the conversation just to make it seem more sugary. It is easy to catch up and reveal for a trained person. If it slips in speed of the moment, just take it back and correct yourself immediately.</p>

<p>Give attentaion to minor details. I cannot do this enough.... Apparently it turns out how well you know a thing is by how basically you can tell about that. Its not easy, but if made an habit - a lot of sleepwalking is avoided. Don't stop at it when the purpose is achieved if there's still more detail to look for.</p>

<p>If you know that you should not do something, yet you're dragged there by mind or by situation - make that thing hard to find or difficult to do. Shouldn't open an app frequently? Uninstall it or move it out of home screen(yes, these days there's app for each thing and everything)</p>

<p><i>10th July 2022</i></p>

<p>Some good learnings and mixed experiences working and with life. Keys:</p>
<p>Look at the mind hungry tasks to work. Everyone can do sleepwalking tasks.</p>
<p>Act on things. Be it wrong or you don't have clue how to do it. Start  it and there's always people who can help the one who starts and shows interest + effort.</p>
<p>If something is not assigned to you which you think should have, someone just thought you're not capable or legible. Just not mind too much and work on  improving at it so that you can changge that view, improve and take up next time. Everything is for a reason and there's always people who are more experienced around you.</p>
<p>This thing I lack a lot - Hop on and talk to people. Build relationships and stay active on conversation ocassionally. This takes things way farther, more than you can ever imagine and in an organization, it opens up so much possibilities for your growth and holstic goodness. So next time, jum onto a conversation and speak up.</p>
<p>No one cares if you don't speak up. Put out your feelings, share and communicate. You can put hours of effort to work and try to learn new things and stay shut or conversate  with people, tell what you're doing, ask ideas and suggestions, feel holistic and learn. This somewhat makes others feel that your'e not just dumb and actually alive doing something.</p>
<p>Take some time out to spare out of doing mainstream work, do some other sidetask and then jump back. This one I think work good for me. Given one work, I can keep on it whole day doing something - but if I do something else pairing with a task, I get a sense of productiveness and efficiency as I switch once I am bore with one or stuck somewhere.</p>
<p>While stuck on something or don't know what to do, hold on and scatterfocus out of it. Take  a pen-paper and write down your steps to realize what you're thinking and doing. Once with me it was so dumb that I was trying to get a feature working building from scratch eventually unfuncional just to realize that the same feature is alreaby built-in and sample code is given in documentation which I have already read sleepwalking through and was just infromt of my eyes. So scatterfocus and just calm down for a while s you can spread attention around spheres.</p>

<p><i>1st July 2022</i></p>

<p>When someone asks you something, its not because theyr'e dumb or jobless or need you - its just that they want to know something from you and couragesour enough to ask up! Think of it for a while and answer appropriately. Likewise when you have something in mind, just ask up....most underrated thng ever. Ask , ask for help, for excuse or for a chance. Who knows what turns out!!! If not immediately, they'll remember you for future chances.</p>

-----

<p><i>7th June 2022</i></p>

<p>You simply can't reject something with no reason. Justification is important and this provides a sens eof assurance and trust for both the parties. If something is in your mind, put it out.</p>

-----

<p><i>6th June 2022</i></p>

<p>Got to meet some cool people at the company. You can't judge someone or something from a look. Sometimes people can be very friendly and sometimees not. If not, that doesn't specifically mean they're closed - but its just not the right time. Or try again.</p>

-----

<p><i>5th June 2022</i></p>

<p>Day before entering to a real job - like corporate for me. Hold not too much expectations anytime.</p>

-----

<p><i>30th May 2022</i></p>

<p>I have a huge confusion in making this judgement - Is it ok to go unfair/against rules/cheat in a situation when you're not able to move in a legitemate path towards the result? I see many around me who are in my same page doing it. But should I? Is it unfair me not doing it?</p>

<p>I fell better when I share my trouble/pain to someone and listenting whatever they say. Many times people tend to normalize me down even it was my fault that caused pain. Keeping it in makes me think more about it, and think that I am thinking more about it - running into a feedback loop of pain in mind.<p>

<p><i>26th May 2022</i></p>

<p>Watched 'Blinded By The Light'. Absolutely great movie. What an art - pleasing, silent, smooth and very touching (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_by_the_Light) and lots to learn. If you know youre doing right, take accountability, risk upon and just keep moving. Consistency is important, never mind what others think of you, your work or whatsoever. Aim, work, keep on it, present it to the commons and rest will be seen.</p>

<p><i>17th May 2022</i></p>

<p> Quick fixes are common all aroud. Focusing on a short term, quick bucks plan is common all around. Its nothing to be a problem, but its just not scalable or compunding most of the time. While thinking of long term and planning something, people hardly trust themsleves and and no one aroud cases as there is no fruit. One who stays in this ballpark for a while, generates and builds self trust and keeps straight on it is likey to reap compounded benefits after a while. At this time, the same people around will think that the bro is lucky and got into a overnight success.... Having self trust and belief in what youre planning and doing is seemingly the key and keep on it, just keep on it.</p>

<p>Its common to see someone judge you based on one occurence sometime and even though you're not that now, you've left that impression on other side. What to do? The best I do is ignore to be on that side and if things come closeby, I just tell them -- that's not how it is now and have come long way away.</p>

<p>Some people are irritating. Moreover there's a correction -- you're irritating to them likely. Or you're so ill minded to think its irritating. Its all on what you think and how you semm to be. Ok, coming back -- if someone is irritating, see why is it. Some people just keep complaining, keep asking  you for help which is 'googleable', keep bothering you with silly reasons and what not! Think why? Ask why? Act on it than staying silent.</p>

<p>Complaining is not the solution. Morons keep doing it,....but see, try to find why is it? Give a second to think of solution, roadmap or what pointers could be brrought to bypass it, slash over it or convince and workaround to bring up a solution. As famously told "Stich in time saves nine".</p>

<p>If you're into something and feel its dry -- be it a online meeting, chat with friends, a planning or sort, then it is definitely dry for you. Try to add value to it if you think so and the critical thing is to follow up. Follow up after talks, after action point discussion, after reading, after project planning or after just a casual chat. This will get things reinforced just like you need to cure the concrete after poring it to build buildings to stay rough and tough.</p>

<p>Environment influences us a lot! A lot infact. What's the difference between being at IIT and say a tier 3 university? Its the people, peers, network. The elite ones are putting efforts in somthing or the other. Doesn't matter where, in what area - but working hard is super important. This gives a sense of competition, awareness in general and keeps someone on track.</p>

<p><i>15th May 2022</i></p>

<p>Its been quite sometime now since I wrote here. Around 3 weeks, I was nowhere ON. Was into learing embedded systems, BMS stuff and semester exams coming up. Not busy, but this was just out of priority. Wasn't getting that spark to write something here and I was trying to slip myself off from this to avoid procrastinating that I haven't written anything here. Trying to get a hang of it as a habit, but not forcefully. But now -- here we go,....</p>

<p>Sometimes I get this burst of interest or thirst for doing something. One of them is reading about peoples thoughts, experiences, writing down information. This may be after I watch a YouTube video(like today I saw children's science fair event -- aboslutely staggered to see what they are doing), a movie rarely or a book!  It makes me pause, think what's going on, what I can do and so on,....</p>

---

<p>Bro! Why are there so many content creators out there :: Its absolutely staggering to see people making podcasts, interviews and all spend good old time watching it and doing nothing(majority). Who is building products? Who is bringing services? I am sure one who does and have plans doesn't really watch a lot of these. Its like a ferrari story -- they don't adverise as people who can afford it aren't infornt of TV all the time! It just feels good to watch these and comment as 'Inspirational'. The one who creates content makes some quick bucks with no brainy thing going around. Just get something, synthesize and broadcast - a labour job.</p>

---

<p><i>14th May 2022</i></p>

<p>Came across a LinkedIn post and someone was saying that Indian software engineers and vast spread and prime movers in US industry bit there is 0 Indian software procuct(as of now). Why? Its really thinkstriking! A large part of comment section conplained that education  system is wrecked(good old joke) and one comment which nearly made sense is that we people look at 'low hanging fruit' meaing a quick short term plan/idea to be happy(mostly to earn). It maybe because of mindset from past, our environment and culture. We are strictly and throughly made to have a hierarchy in a system. Respect older people(ofcourse do), don't go against them, don't give counter talks to them, follow what they day and so on. We like to be ruled. Ancestoral mentality was same, we were ruled by Britishher's for a long time and now still feel good to be in that mindset(a large herd of us). Makes sense, but what can we do? Its definitely changing.</p>

<p><i>22nd April 2022</i></p>

<p>I can 100% trust the person who tells about or shows own mistake, suffering and gives pointers to improve. 99% of things we see daily are just good moments of one's day or just portraited as good moment of one's day. Social media is the ++ among them. Just a few dope shots, a few more, ah,...come on, only a few more.</p>

---

<p><i>21st April 2022</i></p>

<p>I do not defend when I know I am wrong. It may be a bit of compromise to my ego, but I don't want to be dumb to everyone around but me thinking I have sucessfully hidden the mistake.</p>
<p>Use sorry if its just about feelings, use sorry and tell why and how it happened if something has caused because of it, use that Aha! and convey how you could avoid it in future, improve and fix the current mistake if someone tries to point it out and guides.</p>
<p>Sometimes I make mistakes without realizing it. What then?</p>

---

<p><i>20th April 2022</i></p>

<p>If you know you want to do or you don't want to do surely, hold on it being unbiased to what's going on around. But was that judgement mature enough?</p>

---

<p><i>18th April 2022</i></p>

<p>You can get the authority. You can be at that position. You can hold that responsibility. Its all on how you utilize it, how well you spread ideas, knowledge, thoughts to people around with that power.</p>
<p>You can be a teacher and just teach, test, evaluate and go on. Or you can also do that process optimally by engaging with, having some activities, passively evaluating and making sure it reached out well and many more.</p>

---

<p><i>17th April 2022</i></p>

<p>If you are thinking about something and getting no idea on what, how, yes/no -- just speak up. There are always people around you and you'll get insights/answers. Never mind what they think, beacuse no one thinks that you have asked it after you ask as much as you...</p>

---

<p><i>15th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Its easy to get your time sputtered and used for nothing, or infact used for something which means nothing. Why? Why isn't it the other way around naturally?</p>

---

<p><i>13th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Thanks Naval! Here is my message to:</p>
<p><b>10 year old self:</b> Dude, seriously? Don't care or listen to anything specific. Like this suggestion or sort of shits. Let the organs grow. Stay natural and don't try to manipulate anything(especially WhiteHat Jr coding). You're all set back then.</p>  

<p><b>15 year old self:</b> Try to come out of 'I am still young to do things of my own -- will do it later' bubble. Talk a lot, talk to diverse set of people. Explore everything and don't stick to a thing thinking I am doing this for all my life seeing only a cricket match or football over TV. Everyone want's be famous, rich and that's why celebraties fall into our eyes first. Think of struggles, read books, a lot of them and learn about people, what made them to be the person you admire at! Things are not going to be easy neither that hard for next set of years.</p>  

<p><b>20 year old self:</b> Just 20.6 now. Have learnt quite a bit in this couple of years. Try to do things your own way and never mind about whats around. But also have a sense of what's going on. This phase in life is of intense learning -- be it education, about people or life(much more to come). So start learning whatever turns you ON. Be it anything from History to Finance to Science to Engineeering. Seems like things are flipping a lot. Everyone needs to know a bit of everyting and its all running interdisciplinary. Multitask, stay tuned to something streamlined and have a specification tag. You see people younger and of your age winning the world -- try to learn from them, stay tuned to what's trending and mainly and majorly "don't sleepwalk with desires" and making of decisions.</p>  

---

<p><i>13th April 2022</i></p>

<p>When you move at your own direction -- probably out of herd, things around start seeming strange. Everything seems over beurocratic, unnecessary tiresomes, mundane stuffs and a lot more as things can't change easily as you have changed. This kills. Try to covery your idea or why do you think so to bring change in the things around. Else it will stay generic, forever generic.</p>

---

<p><i>12th April 2022</i></p>

<p>People around you won't like you going out of herd. You can go alone if you want and once you start to do so, just leave back the herd's mentality. Not always you'll find this good. Herd helps a lot at times else you need to work super hard for making things done.</p>

---

<p><i>11th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Some days are chill, some are hard, some are suprising. But today was so much inspiring listening to Kumar. Lots to learn from you 🙏. Lots to learn from people arond us -- we just don't get to know unless we stay super kind and heartly. </p>

---

<p><i>10th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Got into a situation of blindly saying 'yes' and then never turned up for it. Also happened couple of times before. Why did I sleepwalk with that answer? That's again a sleepwalk. Ugh,...I am just trying to sort out myself.</p>

---

<p><i>9th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Just wondering how terrible I am at concentrating at one particular thing. Man,..this kills, hurts when you realize.</p>
<p> The Heart of Rose: Concentrate at the centre of rose, admire its texture, breauty, colourfulness, fragnance and eventually you will grow focused, calm, stronger, relaxed and will enjoy a sense of joyfulness with small tings around you -- The Monk Who Sold his Ferrari by Robin Sharma</p>

---

<p><i>6th April 2022</i></p>

<p>If someone is curious about you, your work or sort of it,..you seriously shouldn't neglect the situation or leave it in a smile. Just ask about their thirst, try to share what you can. Think of it -- would you approach someone or ask soemthing just for no reason or for fun? Likely not. So you too give counter curiosity and consider it.</p>

--

<p><i>5th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Not expressing opinions thinking you're small, indominant to the other is not right I think. Just say what you need, what you think, what you do and it really boils down things a lot. And above all, don't try to simplify things to make it sound cool or 'not so rigid'. It will likely be misunderstood on the other side.</p>

---

<p><i>4th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Trying to control a feeling sucks. That entity you're trying to control compounds over and over and makes you think more about it when you're controlling. Just express it and let whatsoever turn out! Anyways worthier than keeping it in :| </p>

---

<p><i>3rd April 2022</i></p>

<p>What do you do when you're put in a group of people who talk a lot, but nothing makes sense to you or ever understandable,...</p>

---

<p><i>2nd April 2022</i></p>

<p>This seems to be true for me! And you? Naval said "Money solves money problems"</p>

---

<p><i>1st April 2022</i></p>

<p>Think of it -- would you spend your time, effort, money for someone without expecting anything? Be super thankful to people who help you without any expectations and strive to give back or contribute in some way... </p>

---
<p><i>30th March 2022</i></p>

<p>If you do not know what to say, just say you do not... These's an option. Why utter something cluttered looking confused and try to patch up things. And if you don't know what to do, pause, ask for suggestions, relate it, apply and proceed. (you is I and I need to learn it by applying it in situations)</p>

---

<p><i>28th March 2022</i></p>
<p>Given words can't be taken back. We tend to make further statements to counter previously made ones. Don't promise when you're confused, suprised or encountered an unexpected situation. Hold on, give it a second, think about it and approach to a decision. Taking a suggestion from someone in midst will really help.</p>

---

<p><i>25th March 2022</i></p>

<p>Follow up is important to keep something on loop if you need to. Be it after a meeting or a conversation, asking a new question or simply saying thanks referring to the context takes the trust, bond to a next level!</p>

---

<p><i>24th March 2022</i></p>

<p>Met Arul boss today. Next level person with that cheerfulness coming from inside always:) Banana-Walnut cakes are really delicious!!!</p>

---

<p><i>19th March 2022</i></p>

<p>Met 2 great friends, YM and AD today @BLR. More than having a large network, its important to stay in touch, updated with with great people and ones who have helped you, trusted you at some point of time. I feel its easy to get connections, but hard to maintain and stay in sync with for a long time. Need to be very thoughtful about it. This is real.</p>

---

<p><i>14th March 2022</i></p>

<p>How to control saturation? Came across someting interesting, looked over it, kindof understood and that then connected to chain of contents finally making me feel that I do not remember where it all started and why am I even doing it!</p>
<p>Pause, get extracts, rethink, note down(most under-rated) and maybe schedule some of it for future. Content is easy to consume -- we often tend to sleepwalk with many of these activities in a generic flow which world/crowd/surroundings follows. Isn't that sick?</p>

---

<p><i>11th March 2022</i></p>

<p>With Great Responsibility, Comes Great Power(inverse of what uncle ben told) holds true? Getting the accountability on ourselves is (not)hard, as self tries to stay away from it. We want to sit, relax warm in a nice soft couch -- but getting up and taking a run around streets can open up some unexpected possibilities which might turn out to be good.</p>

---

<p><i>6th March 2022</i></p>

<p> Choices: Is it good to do a work half an hour each day forever consistently or start with 2 hours a day thinking about continuing forever, but eventually leading to a burnout. Excitement is real while kickstarting. How to hold on with that and eventually harness that excitement for consistently yielding the result? </p>

---

<p><i>25th February 2022</i></p>

<p>Tracking is a next level skill and everyone should try it. Tracking everything from tasks, decisions we make to money will bring a sense to things we make and seepage of time, effort and money can be captured. 50% + of times, we tend to sleepwalk with these things as habits and tracking can bring most of them to context. It can simply start from installing a Digital Wellbeing plug-in to android phone to see how many notifications have poked you that day and how many times you've unlocked, app usage stats etc. These stats are seemingly suprising every time I look at!</p>

<p><i>7th February 2022</i></p>

<p> No harm in jumping into conversations randomly with strangers. Get to know, tell about you, bring that loop into the conversation and try to drop a hook. By 'hook' I mean anything -- be it for an opportunity you're looking for. Be it for getting your content out for publicity, or maybe a simple praise and thanks for conversating.</p>
<p> > Saw some students who got to the bus at the same stop with me and turns out they're freshers and I got to share a Electronics Club enrollment form!</p>
<p> > Just told the conductor of the new electric-bus that it is supercool and very comfortable to travel. He got super happy!</p>
<p> > Went to a shopkeeper asking for 500rs cash in exchange to online payment to 500rs. Turns out he disagreed and demanded 525rs for 500rs cash. Got nothing to excite the randon shopkeeper. Could have nudged something though,....Not everytime it works!</p>

<p><i>1st February 2022</i></p>

<p>Networking, Influence takes the matter to next level. But how to get it? Speak, Praise, Talk in terms of the benefit of other side.</p>

<p><i>31st January 2022</i></p>

<p>Doing and repeating what is already done isn't dumb at all! It can still be scalable and the feel in making it your way is charming.... </p>
<p>Mr.Analog would have done it in a very better way, but only he knows his real journey and the steering pointers he had taken. Doing at your side gives your side of experience and kick!</p>

<p><i>30th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Synthesizing is important. We have everything we (dont)need at the easiest reach and the tool which helps in synthesizing things is a pro. Between, you can also be your own synthesizer!</p>

---

<p><i>29th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Content! And more content! With internet being up for 20+ years and counting, it isn't hard to find the required content. But getting required content is quite hard. Finding is not getting and because its easy to find something, but a lot of distractions, issues, constraints come up on the way of getting it into your arsenal.</p>

---

<p><i>28th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Got an idea? Excited? Hold on a while, think in other dimensions, from someone else's standpoint etc., before springing up and executing it. This really helps make things fault tolerant and provides long shelf-life to the idea.</p>

---

<p><i>27th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Someone told -- to get people come your way, you should genuinely fall in interest with what they do. Might work, but at the same time I feel this has to be done not with the goal of getting people your way. Else that genuinity doesn't exist! So you can't give dumb advice like this to the people.</p>

---

<p><i>26th January 2022</i></p>

<p>We're good at doing similar or cyclic task altogether at once. Be it scheduling a time in a day to send out all emails or to reply to WhatsApp messages. But the urge, curiosity and mainly the fact that it would eventually get forgotten kills....</p>

---

<p><i>25th January 2022</i></p>

<p>E-Learning is good as everything lies at our fingertips. But isn't that killing the curiosity and patience to some extent? There's nothing to crave for and if you think you want to do, you do!</p>

<p><i>20th January 2022</i></p>

<p>If you knew the box, which you have to open, just go for it and start to scratch the surface. No matter how large the key!</p>
<p>This is it -- if you want to go and you don't see the path, still keep going, even if you unfortunately don't know the destination. The fact that you want to go should drive it all! Turns out the effort is worth it even if you hit the wrong destination because you don't know what the destination is!!!</p>

---

<p><i>19th January 2022</i></p>

<p>What I ideally thought: If you are into something important, stay on track, keep yourself on it hard, let whatever happens in world...</p>
<p>What I again thought I should be doing: Yes, keep yourself hard on the task, but at the same time stay compatible with the world and be in syc with events around. This helps and a lot in all fronts. Afterall we are here in the world, for thw world and highly influenced by the own surroundings.</p>

<p>Pause, think and act when you're rude. Decisions made at that instant is irreversible as both the parties will be at high-ego. Or dare to bring down your ego and correct the situation later on! If none, situation will end up like IND-PAK.</p>

<p>Do that thing which you think you can't do!<p>
<p>Sounds like a high level philosophical thought, isn't it? But the way out is to do little by little and trying to be a part of it by making it as a habit. It might be as simple as signing up over email for a volunteering position to a NGO or agreeing to present 4 webinars and rest will gradually follow up in nature's sequence.</p>

<p>Isn't doing the work consistently for a longer span of time better than finshing it up at a really quick pace too early or very lately?</p>
<p>Its told that by doing something for a span of 21 days consistently, you can master anything! or someone told it 20 hrs in a TED talk.</p>

<p>Jump into the pit and try for the way out. No worries if not suceeded instantly. Can always rest, sleep and retry. The decision to jump into it is of utmost power. Give counter thoughts to the negative thoughts which come meanwhile and its OK to self exaggerate the thoughts.</p>
<p>Try things in your own way and be the earliest one to put out issue if hit or in sharing the results. Earliest one is earliest one and rest will follow.</p>

<p>First time tring to pack the day fully scheduled with distributed activities. Truns out it works good for one half, but there's still underflow and uneaten task pending. Another thing is that when hard timeline and separation is put between tasks, natural tendency is - getting compromised with the work whatsoever is completed and trying to catch up with the schedule. This might not involve verifying, proofing etc., in rush.</p>
<p>Still writing this in regret of not coping up with the evening's work(11:10pm now,.....awww) Cheers!!!</p>

<p>Stay calm,...stay as fool. Even if the person infront is yelling at you. This makes them feel they're really going strange at you and eventually freeze themselves. Adding from other side will only increase the intensity as no one's ready to give up their ego in anger. </p>

<p>If something doesn't turn out to be on your side and want it so badly, don't leave it there. Think of opportunities in it(be it a worst case scenario) and drop some fish hooks. See if someting gets caught back again.</p>
<p>If you think you should ask it or not, just ask it. No harm and it only turns out to be a hookup for some opportunity sooner or later!</p>

<p>If someone wants to get your attention and you realize it, just give that damn attention and appretiate the seeker well. Its to utmost feeling for the other side although your mind and ego tries to ignore it. Its mutual and we all need it.</p>
<p>If you want to seek something or so badly ask with someone, just put it straight out as you want it. Our mind tries to cringe and hide, but its all plain on the other person's side and is clueless what's in our mind. Going straight away to it will far better help that going slowly with ten other hints.</p>

<P>Consuming content very good, easy and we have a pile of interesting + exciting content at our disposal mostly for free. But what's next? That now depends on the type of content. Is it entertainment? Get it, laugh, cry or feel it and we never recap it after getting that gratification. Of course, there isn't need too to recap it because that's all that content had to do to us and its over!</p>
<p>There are certain types of content which we consume with a motive to learn or for self-improvement. Since we overwhelmingly consume the earlier type of content, the habit of 'let it go' after consuming it slowly inculcates. Whatever is consumed, try to recap it, take a note of it and physically write it down(the most underrated thing).</p>
<p>We often come across exciting suggestions and promotions. Then we jump on right into it. explore more, explore more about it so much that we end up burning out and this makes us think its all useless or is this really needed? The excitement boils down to self doubt and finally the plan gets dropped. Be it with buying an item online, learning a course, finding people to cold-email for an opportunity or maybe starting to invest in assets. One thing that might help in this is to take the suggestion right down to your mind, think if it it's really helpful for 'you' and then if so, note it down on a calender and make a scheduled plan to execute. This really prevents saturation and takes long way further.</p>

<p>Been 2 months since I touched any EE stuff and my nice mutimeter buttons are eaten by cokroaches in cupboard - hard times won't last long(back to form soon). Not sure if those chips on ESD bag are still crispy with some hopes to get Vcc</p>
<p>Wait and wait and wait,....until some fruitful returns show up. BankBees going up now! Buy some? If you by stocks based on public news, you're not the only one and so that doesn't make much change. But large investors can wake up from nowhere and tune the market. Ufff,....these big giants always have control over and me - a poor kid realizing it after looking at long green candles.</p>

<p>Consistency and long term patience is the key. Be it towards achieving target or investment in stock market. Because it is that you only realize benefit of it when you see a zoomed out version of past in very future, no one tends to care about it.</p>
<p>An opportunity or request comes to you suddenly and if you don't know what to respond, just say OK or YES! Rest always turns out to be good. Our mind may say NO because there is no instant gratification out of it.</p>

<p>Just out of Control Systems exam today. Feedback is important - seek for it at every point, think how i can add value to the people who have trusted, helped and blindly believed.</p>
<p>Learning to remember is shit! Take note of things that can't be remembered and invest in thinking + solving. Start with it even by knowing nothing on it and dare to scratch heads, make no progress but still keep on it.</p>
<p>Remember the past friendly evens and don't hesitate to make someone comfortable even if you get nothing out of it(unless you lose something). But at the same time don't hesitate to say 'no' or lie if it kills your resource.</p>
