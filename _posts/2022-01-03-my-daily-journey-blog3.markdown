<p><i>13th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Thanks Naval! Here is my message to:</p>
<p>10 year old self: Dude, seriously? Don't care or listen to anything specific. Like this suggestion or sort of shits. Let the organs grow. Stay natural and don't try to manipulate anything(especially WhiteHat Jr coding). You're all set back then.</p>  

<p>15 year old self: Try to come out of 'I am still young to do things of my own -- will do it later' bubble. Talk a lot, talk to diverse set of people. Explore everything and don't stick to a thing thinking I am doing this for all my life seeing only a cricket match or football over TV. Everyone want's be famous, rich and that's why celebraties fall into our eyes first. Think of struggles, read books, a lot of them and learn about people, what made them to be the person you admire at! Things are not going to be easy neither that hard for next set of years.</p>  

<p>20 year old self: Just 20.6 now. Have learnt quite a bit in this couple of years. Try to do things your own way and never mind about whats around. But also have a sense of what's going on. This phase in life is of intense learning -- be it education, about people or life(much more to come). So start learning whatever turns you ON. Be it anything from History to Finance to Science to Engineeering. Seems like things are flipping a lot. Everyone needs to know a bit of everyting and its all running interdisciplinary. Multitask, stay tuned to something streamlined and have a specification tag. You see people younger and of your age winning the world -- try to learn from them, stay tuned to what's trending and mainly and majorly "don't sleepwalk with desires" and making of decisions.</p>

<p>When you move at your own direction -- probably out of herd, things around start seeming strange. Everything seems over beurocratic, unnecessary tiresomes, mundane stuffs and a lot more as things can't change easily as you have changed. This kills. Try to covery your idea or why do you think so to bring change in the things around. Else it will stay generic, forever generic.</p>

---

<p><i>12th April 2022</i></p>

<p>People around you won't like you going out of herd. You can go alone if you want and once you start to do so, just leave back the herd's mentality. Not always you'll find this good. Herd helps a lot at times else you need to work super hard for making things done.</p>

<p><i>11th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Some days are chill, some are hard, some are suprising. But today was so much inspiring listening to Kumar. Lots to learn from you üôè. Lots to learn from people arond us -- we just don't get to know unless we stay super kind and heartly. </p>

---

<p><i>10th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Got into a situation of blindly saying 'yes' and then never turned up for it. Also happened couple of times before. Why did I sleepwalk with that answer? That's again a sleepwalk. Ugh,...I am just trying to sort out myself.</p>

---

<p><i>9th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Just wondering how terrible I am at concentrating at one particular thing. Man,..this kills, hurts when you realize.</p>
<p> The Heart of Rose: Concentrate at the centre of rose, admire its texture, breauty, colourfulness, fragnance and eventually you will grow focused, calm, stronger, relaxed and will enjoy a sense of joyfulness with small tings around you -- The Monk Who Sold his Ferrari by Robin Sharma</p>

---

<p><i>6th April 2022</i></p>

<p>If someone is curious about you, your work or sort of it,..you seriously shouldn't neglect the situation or leave it in a smile. Just ask about their thirst, try to share what you can. Think of it -- would you approach someone or ask soemthing just for no reason or for fun? Likely not. So you too give counter curiosity and consider it.</p>

--

<p><i>5th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Not expressing opinions thinking you're small, indominant to the other is not right I think. Just say what you need, what you think, what you do and it really boils down things a lot. And above all, don't try to simplify things to make it sound cool or 'not so rigid'. It will likely be misunderstood on the other side.</p>

---

<p><i>4th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Trying to control a feeling sucks. That entity you're trying to control compounds over and over and makes you think more about it when you're controlling. Just express it and let whatsoever turn out! Anyways worthier than keeping it in :| </p>

---

<p><i>3rd April 2022</i></p>

<p>What do you do when you're put in a group of people who talk a lot, but nothing makes sense to you or ever understandable,...</p>

---

<p><i>2nd April 2022</i></p>

<p>This seems to be true for me! And you? Naval said "Money solves money problems"</p>

---

<p><i>1st April 2022</i></p>

<p>Think of it -- would you spend your time, effort, money for someone without expecting anything? Be super thankful to people who help you without any expectations and strive to give back or contribute in some way... </p>

---
<p><i>30th March 2022</i></p>

<p>If you do not know what to say, just say you do not... These's an option. Why utter something cluttered looking confused and try to patch up things. And if you don't know what to do, pause, ask for suggestions, relate it, apply and proceed. (you is I and I need to learn it by applying it in situations)</p>

---

<p><i>28th March 2022</i></p>
<p>Given words can't be taken back. We tend to make further statements to counter previously made ones. Don't promise when you're confused, suprised or encountered an unexpected situation. Hold on, give it a second, think about it and approach to a decision. Taking a suggestion from someone in midst will really help.</p>

---

<p><i>25th March 2022</i></p>

<p>Follow up is important to keep something on loop if you need to. Be it after a meeting or a conversation, asking a new question or simply saying thanks referring to the context takes the trust, bond to a next level!</p>

---

<p><i>24th March 2022</i></p>

<p>Met Arul boss today. Next level person with that cheerfulness coming from inside always:) Banana-Walnut cakes are really delicious!!!</p>

---

<p><i>19th March 2022</i></p>

<p>Met 2 great friends, YM and AD today @BLR. More than having a large network, its important to stay in touch, updated with with great people and ones who have helped you, trusted you at some point of time. I feel its easy to get connections, but hard to maintain and stay in sync with for a long time. Need to be very thoughtful about it. This is real.</p>

<p><i>14th March 2022</i></p>

<p>How to control saturation? Came across someting interesting, looked over it, kindof understood and that then connected to chain of contents finally making me feel that I do not remember where it all started and why am I even doing it!</p>
<p>Pause, get extracts, rethink, note down(most under-rated) and maybe schedule some of it for future. Content is easy to consume -- we often tend to sleepwalk with many of these activities in a generic flow which world/crowd/surroundings follows. Isn't that sick?</p>

---

<p><i>11th March 2022</i></p>

<p>With Great Responsibility, Comes Great Power(inverse of what uncle ben told) holds true? Getting the accountability on ourselves is (not)hard, as self tries to stay away from it. We want to sit, relax warm in a nice soft couch -- but getting up and taking a run around streets can open up some unexpected possibilities which might turn out to be good.</p>

---

<p><i>6th March 2022</i></p>

<p> Choices: Is it good to do a work half an hour each day forever consistently or start with 2 hours a day thinking about continuing forever, but eventually leading to a burnout. Excitement is real while kickstarting. How to hold on with that and eventually harness that excitement for consistently yielding the result? </p>

---

<p><i>25th February 2022</i></p>

<p>Tracking is a next level skill and everyone should try it. Tracking everything from tasks, decisions we make to money will bring a sense to things we make and seepage of time, effort and money can be captured. 50% + of times, we tend to sleepwalk with these things as habits and tracking can bring most of them to context. It can simply start from installing a Digital Wellbeing plug-in to android phone to see how many notifications have poked you that day and how many times you've unlocked, app usage stats etc. These stats are seemingly suprising every time I look at!</p>

<p> No harm in jumping into conversations randomly with strangers. Get to know, tell about you, bring that loop into the conversation and try to drop a hook. By 'hook' I mean anything -- be it for an opportunity you're looking for. Be it for getting your content out for publicity, or maybe a simple praise and thanks for conversating.</p>
<p> > Saw some students who got to the bus at the same stop with me and turns out they're freshers and I got to share a Electronics Club enrollment form!</p>
<p> > Just told the conductor of the new electric-bus that it is supercool and very comfortable to travel. He got super happy!</p>
<p> > Went to a shopkeeper asking for 500rs cash in exchange to online payment to 500rs. Turns out he disagreed and demanded 525rs for 500rs cash. Got nothing to excite the randon shopkeeper. Could have nudged something though,....Not everytime it works!</p>

<p><i>1st February 2022</i></p>

<p>Networking, Influence takes the matter to next level. But how to get it? Speak, Praise, Talk in terms of the benefit of other side.</p>

---

<p><i>31st January 2022</i></p>

<p>Doing and repeating what is already done isn't dumb at all! It can still be scalable and the feel in making it your way is charming.... </p>
<p>Mr.Analog would have done it in a very better way, but only he knows his real journey and the steering pointers he had taken. Doing at your side gives your side of experience and kick!</p>

---

<p><i>30th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Synthesizing is important. We have everything we (dont)need at the easiest reach and the tool which helps in synthesizing things is a pro. Between, you can also be your own synthesizer!</p>

---

<p><i>29th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Content! And more content! With internet being up for 20+ years and counting, it isn't hard to find the required content. But getting required content is quite hard. Finding is not getting and because its easy to find something, but a lot of distractions, issues, constraints come up on the way of getting it into your arsenal.</p>

---

<p><i>28th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Got an idea? Excited? Hold on a while, think in other dimensions, from someone else's standpoint etc., before springing up and executing it. This really helps make things fault tolerant and provides long shelf-life to the idea.</p>

---

<p><i>27th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Someone told -- to get people come your way, you should genuinely fall in interest with what they do. Might work, but at the same time I feel this has to be done not with the goal of getting people your way. Else that genuinity doesn't exist! So you can't give dumb advice like this to the people.</p>

---

<p><i>26th January 2022</i></p>

<p>We're good at doing similar or cyclic task altogether at once. Be it scheduling a time in a day to send out all emails or to reply to WhatsApp messages. But the urge, curiosity and mainly the fact that it would eventually get forgotten kills....</p>

---

<p><i>25th January 2022</i></p>

<p>E-Learning is good as everything lies at our fingertips. But isn't that killing the curiosity and patience to some extent? There's nothing to crave for and if you think you want to do, you do!</p>

---

<p><i>20th January 2022</i></p>

<p>If you knew the box, which you have to open, just go for it and start to scratch the surface. No matter how large the key!</p>
<p>This is it -- if you want to go and you don't see the path, still keep going, even if you unfortunately don't know the destination. The fact that you want to go should drive it all! Turns out the effort is worth it even if you hit the wrong destination because you don't know what the destination is!!!</p>

---

<p><i>19th January 2022</i></p>

<p>What I ideally thought: If you are into something important, stay on track, keep yourself on it hard, let whatever happens in world...</p>
<p>What I again thought I should be doing: Yes, keep yourself hard on the task, but at the same time stay compatible with the world and be in syc with events around. This helps and a lot in all fronts. Afterall we are here in the world, for thw world and highly influenced by the own surroundings.</p> 

---

<p><i>18th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Pause, think and act when you're rude. Decisions made at that instant is irreversible as both the parties will be at high-ego. Or dare to bring down your ego and correct the situation later on! If none, situation will end up like IND-PAK.</p>

---

<p><i>17th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Do that thing which you think you can't do!<p>
<p>Sounds like a high level philosophical thought, isn't it? But the way out is to do little by little and trying to be a part of it by making it as a habit. It might be as simple as signing up over email for a volunteering position to a NGO or agreeing to present 4 webinars and rest will gradually follow up in nature's sequence.</p>

---

<p><i>16th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Isn't doing the work consistently for a longer span of time better than finshing it up at a really quick pace too early or very lately?</p>
<p>Its told that by doing something for a span of 21 days consistently, you can master anything! or someone told it 20 hrs in a TED talk.</p>

---

<p><i>15th January 2022</i></p>

<p>You won't get thoughts unless you interact with people or by simply being outside.</p>

---

<p><i>14th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Write something when you feel like writing or else you'll end up writing things like this ;)</p>

<p><i>13th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Comfort depends on mentality. If you think you're comfortable, then you are!.</p>

---

<p><i>12th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Jump into the pit and try for the way out. No worries if not suceeded instantly. Can always rest, sleep and retry. The decision to jump into it is of utmost power. Give counter thoughts to the negative thoughts which come meanwhile and its OK to self exaggerate the thoughts.</p>
<p>Try things in your own way and be the earliest one to put out issue if hit or in sharing the results. Earliest one is earliest one and rest will follow.</p>

<p>First time tring to pack the day fully scheduled with distributed activities. Truns out it works good for one half, but there's still underflow and uneaten task pending. Another thing is that when hard timeline and separation is put between tasks, natural tendency is - getting compromised with the work whatsoever is completed and trying to catch up with the schedule. This might not involve verifying, proofing etc., in rush.</p>
<p>Still writing this in regret of not coping up with the evening's work(11:10pm now,.....awww) Cheers!!!</p>

<p><i>10th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Stay calm,...stay as fool. Even if the person infront is yelling at you. This makes them feel they're really going strange at you and eventually freeze themselves. Adding from other side will only increase the intensity as no one's ready to give up their ego in anger. </p>

---

<p><i>9th January 2022</i></p>

<p>If something doesn't turn out to be on your side and want it so badly, don't leave it there. Think of opportunities in it(be it a worst case scenario) and drop some fish hooks. See if someting gets caught back again.</p>
<b>If you think you should ask it or not, just ask it. No harm and it only turns out to be a hookup for some opportunity sooner or later!</b>  

---

<p><i>8th January 2022</i></p>

<p>If someone wants to get your attention and you realize it, just give that damn attention and appretiate the seeker well. Its to utmost feeling for the other side although your mind and ego tries to ignore it. Its mutual and we all need it.</p>
<p>If you want to seek something or so badly ask with someone, just put it straight out as you want it. Our mind tries to cringe and hide, but its all plain on the other person's side and is clueless what's in our mind. Going straight away to it will far better help that going slowly with ten other hints.</p>

<p><i>7th January 2022</i></p>

<p>I hurry too much to close my browsed tabs before the job gets done........</p>
<p>(Ctrl + Shift + T) turns out to be the ultimate saviour.</p>

<p><i>6th January 2022</i></p>

<P>Consuming content very good, easy and we have a pile of interesting + exciting content at our disposal mostly for free. But what's next? That now depends on the type of content. Is it entertainment? Get it, laugh, cry or feel it and we never recap it after getting that gratification. Of course, there isn't need too to recap it because that's all that content had to do to us and its over!</p>
<p>There are certain types of content which we consume with a motive to learn or for self-improvement. Since we overwhelmingly consume the earlier type of content, the habit of 'let it go' after consuming it slowly inculcates. Whatever is consumed, try to recap it, take a note of it and physically write it down(the most underrated thing).</p>
<p>We often come across exciting suggestions and promotions. Then we jump on right into it. explore more, explore more about it so much that we end up burning out and this makes us think its all useless or is this really needed? The excitement boils down to self doubt and finally the plan gets dropped. Be it with buying an item online, learning a course, finding people to cold-email for an opportunity or maybe starting to invest in assets. One thing that might help in this is to take the suggestion right down to your mind, think if it it's really helpful for 'you' and then if so, note it down on a calender and make a scheduled plan to execute. This really prevents saturation and takes long way further.</p>

<p>Been 2 months since I touched any EE stuff and my nice mutimeter buttons are eaten by cokroaches in cupboard - hard times won't last long(back to form soon). Not sure if those chips on ESD bag are still crispy with some hopes to get Vcc</p>
<p>Wait and wait and wait,....until some fruitful returns show up. BankBees going up now! Buy some? If you by stocks based on public news, you're not the only one and so that doesn't make much change. But large investors can wake up from nowhere and tune the market. Ufff,....these big giants always have control over and me - a poor kid realizing it after looking at long green candles.</p>

---

<p><i>4th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Consistency and long term patience is the key. Be it towards achieving target or investment in stock market. Because it is that you only realize benefit of it when you see a zoomed out version of past in very future, no one tends to care about it.</p>
<p>An opportunity or request comes to you suddenly and if you don't know what to respond, just say OK or YES! Rest always turns out to be good. Our mind may say NO because there is no instant gratification out of it.</p>

---

<p><i>3rd January 2022</i></p>

<p>Just out of Control Systems exam today. Feedback is important - seek for it at every point, think how i can add value to the people who have trusted, helped and blindly believed.</p>
<p>Learning to remember is shit! Take note of things that can't be remembered and invest in thinking + solving. Start with it even by knowing nothing on it and dare to scratch heads, make no progress but still keep on it.</p>
<p>Remember the past friendly evens and don't hesitate to make someone comfortable even if you get nothing out of it(unless you lose something). But at the same time don't hesitate to say 'no' or lie if it kills your resource.</p>
