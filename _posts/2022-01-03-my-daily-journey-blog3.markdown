<p>Pause, think and act when you're rude. Decisions made at that instant is irreversible as both the parties will be at high-ego. Or dare to bring down your ego and correct the situation later on! If none, situation will end up like IND-PAK</p>

<p>Do that thing which you think you can't do!<p>
<p>Sounds like a high level philosophical thought, isn't it? But the way out is to do little by little and trying to be a part of it by making it as a habit. It might be as simple as signing up over email for a volunteering position to a NGO or agreeing to present 4 webinars and rest will gradually follow up in nature's sequence.</p>

<p>Isn't doing the work consistently for a longer span of time better than finshing it up at a really quick pace too early or very lately?</p>
<p>Its told that by doing something for a span of 21 days consistently, you can master anything! or someone told it 20 hrs in a TED talk</p>

<p>You won't get thoughts unless you interact with people or by simply being outside.</p>

<p>Write something when you feel like writing or else you'll end up writing things like this ;)</p>

<p>Comfort depends on mentality. If you think you're comfortable, then you are!</p>

<p>Jump into the pit and try for the way out. No worries if not suceeded instantly. Can always rest, sleep and retry. The decision to jump into it is of utmost power. Give counter thoughts to the negative thoughts which come meanwhile and its OK to self exaggerate the thoughts.</p>
<p>Try things in your own way and be the earliest one to put out issue if hit or in sharing the results. Earliest one is earliest one and rest will follow.</p>

<p>First time tring to pack the day fully scheduled with distributed activities. Truns out it works good for one half, but there's still underflow and uneaten task pending. Another thing is that when hard timeline and separation is put between tasks, natural tendency is - getting compromised with the work whatsoever is completed and trying to catch up with the schedule. This might not involve verifying, proofing etc., in rush.</p>
<p>Still writing this in regret of not coping up with the evening's work(11:10pm now,.....awww) Cheers!!!</p>

<p>Stay calm,...stay as fool. Even if the person infront is yelling at you. This makes them feel they're really going strange at you and eventually freeze themselves. Adding from other side will only increase the intensity as no one's ready to give up their ego in anger. </p>

<p>If something doesn't turn out to be on your side and want it so badly, don't leave it there. Think of opportunities in it(be it a worst case scenario) and drop some fish hooks. See if someting gets caught back again.</p>
<b>If you think you should ask it or not, just ask it. No harm and it only turns out to be a hookup for some opportunity sooner or later!</b>

<p>If someone wants to get your attention and you realize it, just give that damn attention and appretiate the seeker well. Its to utmost feeling for the other side although your mind and ego tries to ignore it. Its mutual and we all need it.</p>
<p>If you want to seek something or so badly ask with someone, just put it straight out as you want it. Our mind tries to cringe and hide, but its all plain on the other person's side and is clueless what's in our mind. Going straight away to it will far better help that going slowly with ten other hints.</p>

<p>I hurry too much to close my browsed tabs before the job gets done........</p>
<p>(Ctrl + Shift + T) turns out to be the ultimate saviour</p>

<P>Consuming content very good, easy and we have a pile of interesting + exciting content at our disposal mostly for free. But what's next? That now depends on the type of content. Is it entertainment? Get it, laugh, cry or feel it and we never recap it after getting that gratification. Of course, there isn't need too to recap it because that's all that content had to do to us and its over!</p>
<p>There are certain types of content which we consume with a motive to learn or for self-improvement. Since we overwhelmingly consume the earlier type of content, the habit of 'let it go' after consuming it slowly inculcates. Whatever is consumed, try to recap it, take a note of it and physically write it down(the most underrated thing).</p>
<p>We often come across exciting suggestions and promotions. Then we jump on right into it. explore more, explore more about it so much that we end up burning out and this makes us think its all useless or is this really needed? The excitement boils down to self doubt and finally the plan gets dropped. Be it with buying an item online, learning a course, finding people to cold-email for an opportunity or maybe starting to invest in assets. One thing that might help in this is to take the suggestion right down to your mind, think if it it's really helpful for 'you' and then if so, note it down on a calender and make a scheduled plan to execute. This really prevents saturation and takes long way further.</p>

<p>Been 2 months since I touched any EE stuff and my nice mutimeter buttons are eaten by cokroaches in cupboard - hard times won't last long(back to form soon). Not sure if those chips on ESD bag are still crispy with some hopes to get Vcc</p>
<p>Wait and wait and wait,....until some fruitful returns show up. BankBees going up now! Buy some? If you by stocks based on public news, you're not the only one and so that doesn't make much change. But large investors can wake up from nowhere and tune the market. Ufff,....these big giants always have control over and me - a poor kid realizing it after looking at long green candles.</p>

<p>Consistency and long term patience is the key. Be it towards achieving target or investment in stock market. Because it is that you only realize benefit of it when you see a zoomed out version of past in very future, no one tends to care about it.</p>
<p>An opportunity or request comes to you suddenly and if you don't know what to respond, just say OK or YES! Rest always turns out to be good. Our mind may say NO because there is no instant gratification out of it. </p>

<p>Just out of Control Systems exam today. Feedback is important - seek for it at every point, think how i can add value to the people who have trusted, helped and blindly believed.</p>
<p>Learning to remember is shit! Take note of things that can't be remembered and invest in thinking + solving. Start with it even by knowing nothing on it and dare to scratch heads, make no progress but still keep on it.</p>
<p>Remember the past friendly evens and don't hesitate to make someone comfortable even if you get nothing out of it(unless you lose something). But at the same time don't hesitate to say 'no' or lie if it kills your resource.</p>
