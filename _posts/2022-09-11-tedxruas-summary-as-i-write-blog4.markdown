### The TEDx - YouTube to live presence
<i>9th  November 2023</i>  
Just out of [TEDxRUAS](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/52585) | [FLYER](https://cdn.msruas.ac.in/ruas/media/docs/university/homepage/2023/TEDxRUAS-2023-Invitation.pdf) sitting with this .md file open to jot down the occasion and git push. Absolutely intensive concentration of people with diverse thoughts and from varied domains. I was doubtful about attending, but here we go again! I am always interested to listen to and speak up to people who are very out of what I do. I feel it's just a different lens through which everyone thinks yet converge at a same focal point with aperture size being different people's failures and experiences.  
<p>It started off with a talk by Dr. Thimappa about his thoughts on personality and how to ultimately leave behind a legacy. Keywords revolved around impact creation, self-happiness and taking a leap. He vividly quoted several nursery rhymes and stressing how they hold true in every aspect of life. I somehow don't remember much of what he spoke - is it becuse he's the only one who used slides throughout the talk? Or was I not attentive enough to start with?...</p>
<p>Mr. Pavan spoke about his coaching methods and how he ended up in that path. He pressurized on the point of changing the way of thinking and enjoying the process to suceed in exams. He quoted a real life incident of his father asking him the meaning of a sentence from science textbook and him not knowing it whatsoever, ended up repeating the same sentence again and again shallowly. One funny yet seemingly true thing he said is - the student might not adapt and learn in the 2 years of studying for undergraduate school taking all the stress, but will definitely understand the reality after the exams. And it's ok to fall back and lose in exams, not getting into IITs or top Med school.</p>
<p>Next comes Mr. Vilas who has been into paining from age 3 and took that leap step with all the self trust to pursue the passion of paining after being in corporate. He says daily self-introspection is what made him think about his passion that eventually led him to drop out of the job as HR and take up speed painting as full-time which was known nowhere and he happens to be the first sped painter from India! I have heard something simiar story with Mr. Nakul Abhayankar too in his singing career. He also said that he was not known as rapid painter but after a reality-show gave him and cut-throat time of 3 minutes of air-time to complete a painting, his potential was unlocked.</p>
<p>Dr. Narendra talked more about wellness and how spirituality, mind meditation can help optimize life. I specifically didn't find it contenting probably being at this teen age. Maybe will relaize after some 10 yrs down the line...</p>
<p>Ms. Gayathrie talked about the bold steps taken by her for her career when everything seemed falling apart. Quite amazed by how she's exploring new avenues in life and trying out several activities simultaneously which she says is the advantage of her career path in cinema industry. Goosebumps when her dad was called upto the stage randomly and he talked about her courage - amazing how much he supported her thoughts. He said to keep the chin high and take the shit and punch whatever comes to the face.</p>
<p>Here comes my favourite - Mr. Nicolas. This dude as I'll call is so pleasing to listen to. Absolutely stunning mindset and ceasing of opportunities that fall in place. He came to india for an internship after a course in France and then partnered up with people here to build a restaurant chain Paris Panini. His stories of running a food truck initially and having all the financial cruch, slowly passing by each ones and building an empire is just so blowing to think about. He being a fitness freak even did some pushups on stage with an event organizer who challenged him! At the end he said that as a kid he always dreamt of building a huge fantasy park to play and yet admires if he can build one!</p>
<p>It was a greatly organized event and some common hits were about taking that unwalked, unpopular step although it seemed not too good at the moment but zooming out, they all see it as an enrichingly embarked journey. I just wonder sometimes how to hold up with patience and thorough self-belief but here it is! Got to accept it....</p>
