The topic of cities going slowly unsustainable have been in my mind for a while now and been experiencing in all rounds personally. I often run into discussions on this topic with friends and co-workers, but now thought of writing it down, covering:
- is there a need to think about decentralization
- what are being done about this and are there ways to give a push
- some out of the common thoughts  

This still leaves me with a few questions - cities provide huge exposure and can increase the chances of getting lucky while also often times people migrate with a new ray of hope leaving behind and sacrificing several factors. Happy to discuss around this topic!
