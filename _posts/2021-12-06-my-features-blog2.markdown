[The Best element14 RoadTest Reviews of 2021](https://community.element14.com/products/roadtest/b/blog/posts/the-best-element14-roadtest-reviews-of-2021)  
<p><i>6th December 2021</i></p>

#### The Best Student RoadTester of 2021
<p> We have many students as memebers of the element14 community. Some of them find time between their exams, studies and projects to participate in the roadtest program. So, this award is in recognition for a great roadtest review by an undergraduate college student. For 2021 it is Navadeep Ganesh U. He is currently an EE undergraduate junior year student. I see him participating in a lot of different things on the community. In my interactions with him, I find him easy to work with, eager to learn, and always wanting to try something new. He has completed a few Roadtest Reviews. For a student, I feel he has done an outstanding job. I selected his review of the MAX77714 Multichannel PMIC EVM as an example of great work for a student. Thank You and congratulations, Navadeep.</p>
