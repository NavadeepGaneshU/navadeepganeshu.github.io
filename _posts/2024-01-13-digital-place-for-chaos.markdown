I feel complicated and thoughts and getting subtle thinking about this. I would like to refer one's daily activity in life as [Chaos](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/chaos-theory). Relatable? Everyone comes with certain innate curiosity and this tries to get manifested through every damn channel available. Channels are situations and events that occur to us in daily life. A step back, I have a school of thought that this curiosity comes from how one is brought up - especially the first 10 years of one's life and circle of people and friends one is with. I have probably seen people a dozen different types of people some manifest the curiosity for self-thoughts, some for study and science, some to peek into other people and the best ones yet - some not having a sense of direction and getting curious in all things everything. 
<br>
I feel it's relatable to how companies operate. There is a deep relation between human nature and company philosophies. Some make money out of selling Ads like the social media giants who don't care about the person behind-screen rather only the coins they mint per minute keeping our eyes stuck to it. The curiosity for them is to peek into people and know, understand what I like and keep me ON in their platform. There is a group of high-intellects designing algorithms to tame me on this. Well, if this is one spectrum, others play with the [paradox-of-choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice). This is a situation where multiple different choices are given to build the feeling of have not tried everything. Inherent nature is to go get it all and experience!
<br>
Well, now that it's easy for the [butterfly-effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect) to happen, I am caught. It's interesting how everything goes unrealized. While I to go to the internet to plan for my next trip destination, a notification pops up with some stranger saying 'Hi!'. With no second thought, the response is to check it out. Wait - who drove me there? The innate curiosity? The person behind that screen? or The internet itself? 
<br>
There is a trust factor in this as well. If a good friend of mine says 'hey, have a look at this!' I am more likely to check it out hiding my suspicions. We all know [OLX Army related incidents](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/student-cyber-fraud-cycle-olx-7483770/) or the [JP Morgan Investment](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/karnataka/bengaluru/bengaluru-realtor-falls-for-rs-130-crore-jp-morgan-investment-scam-2840659) ones. It is not always about making money but sometimes to defame, pick fun of someone or just another's set of curiosities to peek into someone. This is why it is tricky. Occurrences are fuzzy and drawing a fine-line is difficult. This is why a lot of social media frauds are difficult to blame anyone. Human nature, curiosity, excitement - where do these come from? Onself! 
<br>
While I am not spared from any of this, we have a giant bubble built up where every molecule is a part of it and the soap water which formed this bubble is introduced by the internet media. All I wanted is to talk what is this but made me write the above as a precursor. Realization is the key. Take a minute to yourself to pause, think where was that initial condition input for the butterfly. It's way easier to stop the situation here. But come on, who doesn't have the curiosity kick in?
<br>
All I have to say for the person with excessive curiosity is 'dude, my heart goes down for you, amen!'
