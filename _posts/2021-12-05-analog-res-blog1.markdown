[Jim Williams Repo](https://community.element14.com/learn/learning-center/b/blog/posts/analog-electronics-resources---jim-williams-repo)  

From nowhere in random, I came across this blogspot called [Reading Jim Williams](https://readingjimwilliams.blogspot.com/) which was all about Jim Williams, his life, works and contributions, authored by a MIT professor - doctor analog. I really thank him for his efforts in putting everything together and it's amazing to see a lot from the back, his views on circuits, designs and the art of Jim Willams with insightful explanations throughout his AppNotes(doc attached below).
