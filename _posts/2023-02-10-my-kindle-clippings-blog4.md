psychologists have noted that there are four levels of competence or learning. The first, known as ‚Äúunconscious incompetence,‚Äù is when you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know. For example, you might not even be aware of the fact that something like speed-reading exists. So, you‚Äôre also not aware that you‚Äôre currently not capable of doing it. In the next level, known as ‚Äúconscious incompetence,‚Äù you‚Äôre aware of what you don‚Äôt know. For example, you‚Äôre aware that people have learned to read and comprehend much faster through speed-reading techniques, but you yourself have not had any training in this area, nor do you understand what tools are necessary to become a speed-reader. The third level is ‚Äúconscious competence.‚Äù What this means is that you‚Äôre aware of a skill and have the capacity to perform that skill, but only when you actively put your mind to it. You can do it, but it takes work.
