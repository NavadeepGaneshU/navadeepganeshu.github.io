# Get Epic Shit Done (Warikoo, Ankur) (z-lib.org)
by Warikoo, Ankur

## Highlights and Notes

### Part 1: Managing Your Life

First, understand that our ability to communicate verbally is a direct reflection of our ability to structure our thoughts clearly. And that begins by writing!

Entitled people don‚Äôt grow. They wait to be grown! Because they believe the world owes them everything they desire.

if I spend time with people who are nothing like me, it will broaden my horizon. If I think of risk as something to be understood and not eliminated, I draw the courage to act beyond fear. And if I do so in a manner that I am never entitled, I ensure that I grow in the process.

Because you would have spent time observing yourself as someone external to you would.

If you are feeling the emotion of jealousy, its purpose is to make you aware of the inadequacy you are feeling in your own life. If you are feeling the emotion of anger, its purpose is to make you aware of an unfulfilled need within yourself. The minute you observe the emotion and realize the reason behind it, the emotion disappears. Because its purpose has been served.

### Part 4: Managing Yourself

But we all hate to reflect, to pause. We are scared of what we might discover when we sit to reflect.

So most people get comfortable avoiding rather than being aware.

## Highlights and Notes

### Front Matter

One of the lessons I have learned in my own life is that if you don‚Äôt act on life, life has a habit of acting on you. The days slip into weeks, the weeks slip into months and the months slip into years. Pretty soon it‚Äôs all over and you are left with nothing more than a heart filled with regret over a life half lived.

Finding your calling doesn‚Äôt mean you must leave the job you now have. It simply means you need to bring more of yourself into your work and focus on the things you do best. It means you have to stop waiting for other people to make the changes you desire and, as Mahatma Gandhi noted:‚ÄúBe the change that you wish to see most in your world.‚Äù And once you do, your life will change.

The golden thread of a highly successful and meaningful life is self‚Äì discipline. Discipline allows you to do all those things you know in your heart you should do but never feel like doing.

when you consistently flex your willpower by making those choices that you know are the right ones(rather than the easy ones), you take back control of your life.

‚ÄúPerhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not.‚Äù

Remember, happy people have often experienced as much adversity as those who are unhappy. What sets them apart is that they have the good sense to manage their memories in a way that enriches their lives.

Those who take more chances and dare to be more and do more than others will naturally experience more failures.

The act of caring for my physical temple reminds me that life‚Äôs greatest pleasures are often life‚Äôs simplest ones.

Experiencing solitude, for even a few minutes a day, will keep you centered on your highest life priorities and help you avoid the neglect that pervades the lives of so many of us.

To live your life to the fullest, start taking more risks and doing the things you fear. Get good at being uncomfortable and stop walking the path of least resistance. Sure, there is a greater chance you will stub your toes when you walk the road less traveled, but that is the only way you can get anywhere.

The real secret to getting control of your life is to restore a sense of focus in your days. The real secret to getting things done is knowing what things need to be left undone. Once you start spending the hours of your days only on those high‚Äì leverage activities and priorities that will advance your life‚Äôs mission and legacy, everything will change.

How high you will rise in your life will be determined not by how hard you work but by how well you think.

And the person you will be five years from now will come down to two primary influences: the people you associate with and the books you read.

To let go of the mental clutter that your problems tend to generate, list all your worries on a piece of paper. If you do so, they will no longer be able to fester in your mind and drain your valuable energy. This simple exercise will also permit you to put your problems into perspective and tackle them in an orderly, well‚Äì planned sequence.

You will never be able to eliminate a weakness you don‚Äôt even know about. The first step to eliminate a negative habit is to become aware of it. Once you develop an awareness about the behavior you are trying to change, you will be well on your way to replacing it with one that is more helpful.

By developing present moment awareness and an abundance of mental focus, you will not only feel much calmer in your life, you will also unlock the fullness of your mind‚Äôs potential.

One of the best ways to cure your monkey mind is through a technique I call‚ÄúFocused Reading.‚Äù Every time your mind wanders from the page into a daydream or a worry, make a check mark in the right hand margin of the page. This simple act will increase your awareness of how poorly you concentrate and, since awareness is the first step to change, help you to build the skills you need for a clearer, quieter mind.

The more you ask, the more you get, but it takes practice to get good at it.

The foods you consume affects your moods as well as the clarity of your thinking. This is why the ancient sages ate only light foods. They knew that anything more would disturb the perfectly peaceful minds they had worked so hard to cultivate and disrupt their meditations on the true meaning of life.

Take a good, hard look at your environment. Your thoughts are shaped by the people you associate with, by the books you read, by the words you speak and by your daily physical surroundings.

Without a discipline mind, trivial thoughts and worries will nag at you and you will never have the capacity to immerse yourself in more meaningful pursuits. Without deep concentration, your mind will be your master rather than your servant.

‚ÄúTake the course opposite to custom, you will almost always do well.‚Äù The brilliant ads for Apple computers inspire us to‚ÄúThink Different.‚Äù Or as I tell audience at my leadership speeches,‚ÄúIf you follow the crowd, the place you will most likely end up at is the exit.‚Äù

At the end of the day, the only thing we can take with us are our memories of all those great life experience that add meaning to our lives. Given this, I would rather spend my days doing things that will leave me happy memories than collecting possessions. I have discovered that my best memories come from life‚Äôs simplest things.

To form your own mastermind alliance, find three or four people you feel you could learn from and who would get along well with the others of the group. The alliance is all about mutual benefit so you must be able to give as much as you expect to receive.

One of the traits I respect most in people is humility.‚ÄúThe tree that has the most fruits is the tree that bends to the ground,‚Äù

it is not the number of hours of sleep that is key but rather the amount of renewal your body receives. Strive for less time in bed but a richer, deeper sleep. Understand that fatigue is often a mental creation that stems from doing tings you do not like to do.

The heights by great men reached and kept Were not attained by sudden flight But they, while their companions slept, Were toiling upwards in the night.

‚Äúfake it till you make it.‚Äù In other words, you can pretend to be the kind of person you wish to be. By consistently acting as a highly enthusiastic person might or as a truly confident person would, you will eventually take on these personal attributes.

the‚Äúacting as if‚Äù technique is a highly effective way to modify your behavior and transform yourself into the person you plan to be.

When you love your job, you discover you will never have to work another day in your life. Your work will be play and the hours will slip away as quickly as they came.

## Highlights and Notes

### Chapter 1. Introduction

weakness found in altogether too many people, is the habit of measuring everything, and everyone, by their own impressions and beliefs.

### Chapter 3. Faith

FAITH is the head chemist of the mind. When FAITH is blended with the vibration of thought, the subconscious mind instantly picks up the vibration, translates it into its spiritual equivalent, and transmits it to Infinite Intelligence, as in the case of prayer.

### Chapter 5. Specialized Knowledge

KNOWLEDGE will not attract money, unless it is organized, and intelligently directed, through practical PLANS OF ACTION, to the DEFINITE END of accumulation of money.

### Chapter 6. Imagination

reduce your plan to writing, if you have not already done so. The moment you complete this, you will have DEFINITELY given concrete form to the intangible DESIRE.

DESIRE is thought impulse! Thought impulses are forms of energy. When you begin with the thought impulse, DESIRE, to accumulate money, you are drafting into your service the same‚Äústuff‚Äù that Nature used in creating this earth,

As far as science has been able to determine, the entire universe consists of but two elements‚Äî matter and energy. Through the combination of energy and matter, has been created everything perceptible to man, from the largest star which floats in the heavens, down to, and including man, himself.

Ideas are intangible forces, but they have more power than the physical brains that give birth to them. They have the power to live on, after the brain that creates them has returned to dust.

### Chapter 9. Persistence

People refuse to take chances in business, because they fear the criticism which may follow if they fail. The fear of criticism, in such cases is stronger than the DESIRE for success.
