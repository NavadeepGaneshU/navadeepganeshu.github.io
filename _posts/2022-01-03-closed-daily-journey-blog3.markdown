Couldn't find anything close to this in a long time [A man tries to end his life -- but blows a fuse. Then he goes on a journey to replace it](https://youtu.be/7WFXEQx6N3s?si=iYbLAn2idVLN_PgI). Takes human emotion to it's edge.

<i>2nd December 2023</i>

<p>It's interesting and hitting at the same time how emotions control the decisions made. At some point in the beginning, things are thought crazily wild and as the time nears for actual situation, I feel there is a resistance/hesitation/friction and somehow then get pushed to it. The people around, type of content i've watched or listened online plays a part in this I suppose. Dreams start appearning about there if there is an anxiety or too much excitement associated with it.</p>
<p>Was at LITFEST2023 today and an amazing event it was! Started with carnatic music vocalist and then listening to a dozen of authors about their books. Unboxing Bengaluru was the first one and the authors went on picturing how bengaluru has layers within it and differentiation factors compared to other cities. No one can miss that point about weather. Ome emphasis was that the poeple in bengaluru are open and of welcoming culture. The time people networked and got together is the shortest in bengaluru and people have high mutual trust with each other which no other city has.</p>
<p>Sudha Murthy then talked about 'small things' of life that we often fail to observe and appretiate. She narrated a story of going to relatives homes for luch and getting dabbas back for dinner as an excuse for not to cook. One thing that stood out is that 'authors observe and write things through their thought process' which many others may not see or even think and relate while just sleepwalking with happenings and routine. Went on with more fictional, history book authors and later comes brand-galuru author who takes snippets of stories of businesses that got buit from bengaluru to the world. Radel, Amrut Malt being some of them.</p>

<i>27th November 2023</i>

<p>Getting back to daily thoughts as I have been quite inconsistent at it. I keep telling this and think atleast  thrice a week. Probably mind's way to zone out from doing hard things - it takes effort to do this, reflect yourself and unlearn/relearn. Currently reading The Art of Bitfulness. Realizing is important and only comes by either doing it, failing at it or reading it. One of the faster way is by reading and this book just brings so much bittertruths. Never have I ever got so much concerned hearing a browser notifcation from LinkedIn(all other social apps muted years ago) or a phone ringing up. I am trying to tend to a point where I can respond to people bugging me(be it for a reason or not) whenever I want to purposefully. I have noticed once I get carriedd away, average time spent is 20mins until reverting back. It's so akward how mind loses it's purpose and I get driven by others for no reason or for just a binge chat. Rationalizing important is what I am trying. One thing that helps me along the way is writing that thought down in a paper while distraction comes in. It's funny - but it's a vicous circle that makes me think I will forget to text someone or tell something or browse some content if I do not do it right now and that thought bugs again and again until I pick the phone or laptop and do it. Writing down relieves it and I know it's on paper and I can do it later!</p>

<p>Decluttering helps a lot. Taking things lightly on the first listen, adapting to the happening and being greatful to whatever it is you are now are the things I noted as Nitin Kamat says about his family and life with his wife as she passes through tough times. Not listening to people around and thinking it's all it is not a good thing as well. Who knows - they might not have the though process you have and probably more wiser as society thinks.</p>

<p>Come on! Who else hates this with me - a person joing in middel of an interesting conversation of yours with a close friend and derailing it with bullshit... above that trying to bug you and get their curiosity served. Hurts haha. I find it hard to judge people. Or should not judge at all? No I think. People should be judged - otherwise how to be aware? But maybe not too fast. Got to take time to understand their behaviour and interests and zone out if there is no alignment just for timeless fun, praise or self fulfilling talks. Got to know what you want out of a moment and drive things towards it. Else time will seem like gone. Isn't it? I am just realizing this now. Start conversation with a purpose and go with the takeaway you want - all by not being too self-centric and making it well two sided and exciting for everyone.</p>

### The TEDx - youtube to live presence
<i>9th  November 2023</i>  
Just out of [TEDxRUAS](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/52585) | [FLYER](https://cdn.msruas.ac.in/ruas/media/docs/university/homepage/2023/TEDxRUAS-2023-Invitation.pdf) sitting with this .md file open to jot down the occasion and git push. Absolutely intensive concentration of people with diverse thoughts and from varied domains. I was doubtful about attending, but here we go again! I am always interested to listen to and speak up to people who are very out of what I do. I feel its just a different lens through which everyone thinks yet converge at a same focal point with aperture size being different people's failures and experiences.  
<p>It started off with a talk by Dr. Thimappa about his thoughts on personality and how to ultimately leave behind a legacy. Keywords revolved around impact creation, self-happiness and taking a leap. He vividly quoted several nursery rhymes and stressing how they hold true in every aspect of life. I somehow don't remember much of what he spoke - is it becuse he's the only one who used slides throughout the talk? Or was I not attentive enough to start with?...</p>
<p>Mr. Pavan spoke about his coaching methods and how he ended up in that path. He pressurized on the point of changing the way of thinking and enjoying the process to suceed in exams. He quoted a real life incident of his father asking him the meaning of a sentence from science textbook and him not knowing it whatsoever, ended up repeating the same sentence again and again shallowly. One funny yet seemingly true thing he said is - the student might not adapt and learn in the 2 years of studying for undergraduate school taking all the stress, but will definitely understand the reality after the exams. And it's ok to fall back and lose in exams, not getting into IITs or top Med school.</p>
<p>Next comes Mr. Vilas who has been into paining from age 3 and took that leap step with all the self trust to pursue the passion of paining after being in corporate. He says daily self-introspection is what made him think about his passion that eventually led him to drop out of the job as HR and take up speed painting as full-time which was known nowhere and he happens to be the first sped painter from India! I have heard something simiar story with Mr. Nakul Abhayankar too in his singing career. He also said that he was not known as rapid painter but after a reality-show gave him and cut-throat time of 3 minutes of air-time to complete a painting, his potential was unlocked.</p>
<p>Dr. Narendra talked more about wellness and how spirituality, mind meditation can help optimize life. I specifically didn't find it contenting probably being at this teen age. Maybe will relaize after some 10 yrs down the line...</p>
</p>Ms. Gayathrie talked about the bold steps taken by her for her career when everything seemed falling apart. Quite amazed by how she's exploring new avenues in life and trying out several activities simultaneously which she says is the advantage of her career path in cinema industry. Goosebumps when her dad was called upto the stage randomly and he talked about her courage - amazing how much he supported her thoughts. He said to keep the chin high and take the shit and punch whatever comes to the face.</p>
<p>Here comes my favourite - Mr. Nicolas. This dude as I'll call is so pleasing to listen to. Absolutely stunning mindset and ceasing of opportunities that fall in place. He came to india for an internship after a course in France and then partnered up with people here to build a restaurant chain Paris Panini. His stories of running a food truck initially and having all the financial cruch, slowly passing by each ones and building an empire is just so blowing to think about. He being a fitness freak even did some pushups on stage with an event organizer who challenged him! At the end he said that as a kid he always dreamt of building a huge fantasy park to play and yet admires if he can build one!</p>
<p>It was a greatly organized event and some common hits were about taking that unwalked, unpopular step although it seemed not too good at the moment but zooming out, they all see it as an enrichingly embarked journey. I just wonder sometimes how to hold up with patience and thorough self-belief but here it is! Got to accept it....</p>

### Serendipity kick in! Something out of blues...
<i>28th October 2023</i>
<p>Just realizing that the year is almost getting over. It felt like 2023 is far away and it is my graduation year. Have kept 2023 as a year of goals and it's just slipping through. Had an alumni meet at university today with EEE and ECE students. The invitation was sent a long back and a couple of days ago, I saw a message in the group about giving a talk in the alumni meet occassion. I just reacted with a :thumbs up to that message thinking 'yeah, good they're allowing some alumni's to talk and let me listen'. The day of the meet in the morning, I saw a message from the organizer that Navadeep will be the speaker today! That was a shock - literally! </p>
<p>For some reason I thought yeah, opportinity has knocked the door let it in now. So talked to the organizer and confirmed it. I was the second speaker and started out the talk with the same story of how this randoomly turned out. Everyone laughed at my naiveness and it was my first of it's kind. Had never stood infront of say 150 people. Then I talked what I do now at work and shortly about how the college times were. Wrapped in in probably 3 minutes....after getting a lot of audience chatter whome I couldn't snatch the attenton from becasue of my 'reduced voice level' as my well connected friend in audience reported me after the talk.</p>
<p>Well, I got to meet some 'cool' friends from ECE - Yuvjeeth and Anurag. You see them and will just be able to spot those out of mediocrity. One guy has often made too much noise in college throughout 4 years but a very thriving one. Somehow I can just make out by listending to a  guy for a minute as to where they stand. Someone with a good sense of humour, not blaming others for happenings and taking it on onself as luck or hardwork, being enthusiastic of what they do and asking questions that you feel good about is a clear sign of this. Seldom these people are in midst of the crowd.</p>
<p>Overall a fun alumni meet - having some regrets of not approaching to new people(cringing with this again as always) although I saw some nice people around(just saying). Suffered a snakebit punchure in cycle tube on my way back in Peenya and after some 40 minutes of fiddling around, fixed it and headed back. Ended the day watching 'Serendipity(2001)' movie which is a lovely one.</p>

### One fun day - almost missed
<i>16th October 2023</i>
<p>Jumped into [Raphsody 2023](https://rhapsodyiisc.co.in/) last night after suddenly getting reminded by a friend. Although I had registered earlier, I thought of dropping it as one of the prior mails sent by the organizers did not have my registration in top 1000 who were supposed to be allowed dute to exhausive registration. Nevertheless, would have certainly regreted we had not gone. Risked the cycle by parking it next to a bus station near KV ground and boom! After some struggle to ge in, with the llegacy ID card I was in! Event started with a guitar music by Arya Salvi "ARYA LIVE" and after some guitar based music, the blast came in with Sunidhi Chauhan Live. A lot of bollywood songs she had sung earlier and after a bit of low energy songs, the beats went high and the floor shook. Went crazy dancing and jumping around. Probably my second experience of this kind - after a night by Alok "ALLOK" earlier in Ramaiah campus. Something that's learnt is that if not attempted or held back from giving a try, its always missed :)</p>

### Back to Reflection 101
<i>21st September 2022</i>
<p>In midst of learning music with flute after a random desire to go hands on with one musical instrument. Thanks to this song https://youtu.be/EagQ7ODyT-A?si=vomlMWYtKethKFjX ....lol. Its interesting how people stick on to a thing for a really long time. Was just watching about Nakul Abhayankar and some pro musicians.</p>
<p>Too much noise around, been consuming a lot of content lately and actions probably got reduced. The availability of content is just next level and everything is infront on a snap. What gives dopamnie shots are the deeling of 'what's new now', 'who's replied to my text' etc,. and the feeling of craving to know about something for a long time has ceased. At a point where I can't really figure out in the fuzziness as to what next? What's in long term with me and me. People present different ideas - a lot that its confusing to streamline and stick into one and trying everying in portions isn't seeming to be effective or I run of resources. If not it drains too much of power in thinking and managng those.</p>
<p>Last few months have been a pretty stagnant in terms of technicallyy learning new things - can feel that change of moving out of college and buzz of constant learning. I am loving to stay in that flow but have been consuming a lot of content all about startups, money, music and life of people. One common trait is that it seems to be all long term. People in plan or without it end up big after doing something recurringly for a really prolonged amount of time. Just ended up watching this and punch line is here https://youtu.be/nGpir4oUfJI?si=YCW7GfiWLsumjEgi&t=1700 . Also read something interesting that momentum is all one needs and it is mass times velocity. Velocity is great to have but it without mass is quite not significant. Mass is something which can be built from practice, reading, trying out repeatedly or whatever by means of taking time.</p>

### Trying to do what my mind says not to do - Having no clue!
<i>5th August 2023</i>
<p>Never mind! who haven't heard this. Did I ever not mind after hearning never mind? Wasn't possible. Everyting that's said, I end up minding about it. Its what brain says - youre intentionally wired to do it. Just like "can you for 10 seconds close your eyes and not think about elephant?" Insane thing is the mind...haha</p>
<p>I am almost everyday reminded of writing here and everyday I postpone it for some reason that my mind says - something like "come on, today is excuse, lets write tomorrow", "not anything to write today", "bored and done for the day - let me just watch some YouTube and go off"..etc. But I am trying to learn to do the opposite of what mind says. Often fail, rarely suceed ifever.</p>
<p>I feel like inherently, my mind or everyone of our's is wired in some way based on how we grew up and trained  in early ages (Tip: Reading a book called 'Limitless' by Jim Kwik and somewhere half way through) Its also is heavily dependednt on what we have seen, expereinced and gone through in prior phases of life. Its quite evident that people whith some kind of disability or who went through a lot of unfair instances in life push harder towards goals than who is all set and fluently passes through the phases of life. Its all about the goal and learning. The day's, month's or lifetime goal is what wakes me up excited and gives the initial push. But setting a short, mid and long term goal all aligned in the same line and accomplishing  through phases of learning is what i feel is utmost necesary. Still of the figuring out phase. Having no clue!</p>
<p>I often feel I was lowballed as a kid - no one told what to do and never discussed about what's happening in people's personal life(be it parents, elder or anyone). And as many others, got carried away in the typical sail of education running through the phases of education as a rat race without realzing why, what next and what it takes to go up in incremental phases! Everyone is super private about some things - say about money. Money was never discussed in the table and somehow parents conservatively manage all the expenses. Is it not that the more you discuss about money and desire for it, the more it comes to you? Ofcourse with a hardwork put-up as always. And above all, holding the unexisting perstige about onself.</p>

### New day, new things to see, regret and learn...
<i>2nd June 2023</i>
<p>Usually I am neutral with people's feelings and not sure if its good or bad, trying to get more empathetic. Around me, lately after meeting a lot of poeple at work or casually around of the age group as of mine, they are in a spectrum of types. Some have strong opinions about what they think, some with high confirmational bias, someone who get quickly triggered and offended and suprisingly someone who is an active listener and does all the reception of what you say and behaves very passive to what you ask back. The last type of people often unrealistically praise, come up with weird questions from nowhere(as you may feel) and inturn gathers information from you what they want. I eventually try to ignore such if identified, but it happened to seem that these people think that everyone around is thinking about them and try to give bad suprises. It does seem bad when one realizes that all those conversations that happened before meant something which was just kept in stelath even after asking about it. My honest questions to such people are: Do you think everyone around you is waiting for you? Do you think it can make you seem high? Dumb! No. Just be 1:1 while talking and interacting whth people and its possible to do so if you want to pay even in the game. I agree that one should be ready to be hated and can't be liked by everyone - but there is a 0 to 100 gauge and staying in the second half is better right?</p>

<p>Boom! forgot what happened last day. It was my end day at the palce I was interning. This opportunity came up unexpectedly and was definitely worth it engaging with this project. Lots to learn about product's developemnt phase, customers and more... Above all we were lucky to have a great founder A - in all terms. A was leeping trust with the team members and empathetic. Used to feel like working with a buddy who's close to me and with me tecnically and ethically. Thanks A for the amazing farewell party at your home. Loved the time with your company and I'm sure we cross paths again in the future.</p>

### Something out of nowhere!
<i>30th May 2023</i>

I was browsing through titanic ship story - invoked by a recent titan vessel implosion and reading through few of the artefacts recovered from the titanic ship site sunk in 1912, violin seemed a very intersting one. It was reported to be made of rosewood and looks very intact still. Got to know that it wasn't recovered from the sea, but from the body of the musician who played it during the search operation 10 days after the tragedy. Interesting fact was that the  group of musicians continued to play the violin as the ship sunk in - so told to keep the people calm with the music melody... This led to me listening to some violin music videos and told to be probably one of the difficult musical instrument to learn. First time I ever lisened live was in the freshers day event back in 2019 at college and it was quite amazing. I do want to learn this instrument sometime and be able to play the music whetever earworms around my mind. Hit across this one and can't stop listening,...probaly 15 times already in a loop https://youtube.com/shorts/EagQ7ODyT-A?feature=share

### Why's that happening?
<i>29th May 2023</i>

<p>Was getting tied around a lot of stuff for couple of years now and probably I was doing it purposefully to keep myself occupied in only certain things - university classes, exams and assignments(these hit hard with long procrastimation and last minute terror often), internship and freelancing... and there was sense of urgency and feeling of being overoccuplied which used to probably keep my subconcious mind in alert mode most of the time? or not but I feel so. After getting down of university stuff and no more academic tasks to be done which are judged by someone and graded, things start to feel a bit lighter. Not precisely, but to say, mind doesn't work as it was before. Getting quite staggered with morining alertness and wakeup punctuality, not getting the ability to time things up and priorotize and probably lost with opeining Gmail, LinkedIn and whataspp randomly to poll for updates...</p>
<p>Its getting quite evident that for me its not getting too good to feel very freed and it makes to having no sense of push for doing a task on plate(my bad - type A here) although I have planned for working on an online project and blogging. YouTube bingewatching, eating junk food/crackers also caught me...yucks. Trying to get control over it - probably by engaging with needful tasks in terms of career, upskilling, learning from reading books or yesh! some cycling.</p>

### Realization and introspection mattered
<i>23rd May 2023</i>

It's been a while since I had written something here and a lot has changed in a while it seems. A summary?
* I have been thinking what I wanted to do full-time after graduation. I am quite sure that I want to work in a bleeding tech environment, contribute and fairly earn from it. Zooming out now and seeing it all what happened in the last 4 years makes it seem i was polling continuously and explored quite a lot of areas, types of organization, people and opportunities. I am now able to easily spot scam opportunities that come in the way,..haha
* It seems over the COVID lockdown time a lot of these people and low-ball businesses(so called) started to come up and everything  online was well entertained due to the heavy traffic of people just bingesurfing online. Consumption was extreme and seldom did people act on what they consumed online. Blame was the situation and looking back, there seemed to have a lot of lucrative hotspots in terms of investments and starting a business. Ok - springing back, all I did during that time was renting my time and put a lot of effort towards learning by doing things. This didn't turn out to be a great thing to do although there was effort put in but I feel it wasn't streamlined.
* Introspection and realization of what to do, how to do and what might happen if this is done is important to get anything done properly. Without a desire or thought of getting wealthy, its rarely possible to happen and so planning and extreme amount of effort matters. Knowing what to do early on is hard and if its figured out, its almost possible to get anywhere with that roadmap. I spent time learning electronics, working with startups, freelancing and writing a lot of proposals to what I can do and how I can do the work. Everything seemed lucrative and interesting and I acted as a kid in the candy store when opportunities came by. LinkedIn is what I started using a lot and it opened up some new opportunities and the ability to connect with people easily(although rarely people get involved in the conversation fruitfully). Everyone is searching for something and trying to catch hold of some opportunity and in the rush, miss out real networking through this platform. Its just like you're said to have a project discussion in a classroom while the professor is monitoring contrary to the same discussion happening alongside a dinner with the same set of people.
* It is good to have someone guide and mentor in the path while a lot of work is being put in by oneself. Because someone who has walked in the similar path will be fairly easily be able to zoom-in and zoom-out of what is happening and what might go to happen because of their own experiences. I least cared about these and sill I am.... which led to getting to a hell lot of places and just judging things myself. This often took time, waiting if it is going to change and then getting fuzzy as to what I am doing.
* Some companies, and people I met along these days:
  - First I saw a person who was confident about his own business and product without knowing the tech himself and had outsourced a major chunk of hardware and software design to a freelancer in Turkey. He asked me to design the system initially to which I blindly agreed and then he had already outsourced it to that freelancer and wanted me to test the design to which also I agreed knowing it was quite possible by me. This person then suddenly called me up and told  he'll be shipping the whole test setup to my home including a huge barrel and setup with water flow testbench. I wasn't confident about that having to keep such a high worth thing and take the stake. Silently disagreed and then never heard back. Been avoiding his contact then on.
  - Then came a high-spirited company who said to be based out of US and India and was tirelessly working on getting their product designed. I hit across this opportunity and with no second thought, took it up. They wanted free-working interns and we were a bunch of 50 people from more than 10 countries. It was a fun time and I lead the hardware design. This experience did immensely help me in learning how to build power electronics, embedded systems and full-stack PCB design. I probably felt kiddish to understand business stuff which used to overhear from the weekly team meetings but wish I had given some more attention to those because customers, people and the public are what vouch for the product and decides if it is fit. Anything can scale wide if the use case comes down to a common person and competition, uniqueness doesn't matter there. Like how many soap brands coexist with close to no difference and see things like toothpaste, clothing, beverages etc.
  - I was still not sure if I had to do any of these full-time and so to see what crowd follows and is told to be renowned and stable, I took up an opportunity and Bosch battery team. My god! Such a big company, billion-dollar battery industry and was able to see how a star product is buit by a team of probably thousands. This company specifically ran very stable with no worry and hurry of launching the product, but to stay abreast with the competitors. Things seemed to happen very systematically here and a lot of validation. Multiple people were doing the same work and easily I could see someone being replaced or just moved out and nothing changed in the team. People are extremely friendly, and supportive too with what they know and some star employees could be spotted here and there who essentially drive the team irrespective of the position seniority. I learnt many new testing methodologies, using some hy-end equipemnts and softwate tools and majorly did model-based design and ported some algorithms for battery applications. At this point, I am quite sure that it doesn't make much sense for someone of my type as a fresher beginning their career out of here.
  - Somehow at this point, I saw a lot of my contacts who seemed to do great work were in the embedded software domain and this was one of the things I had worked on to some extent in some of my previous roles and so started to drift in that way. Opportunities were plenty and a fairly good payscale was evident. One opportunity in embedded software came my way in an MNC but I just thought I was not yet prepared to pursue it and also had joined the earlier mentioned company Bosch. So continuing the upskilling journey and multiple failed attempts to get into these roles, I hit a glacier of self-doubt. Am I really good at this? Can I do this full-time? Why don't this company think I am capable for this work even after interviewing 3 times and multiple rounds?
  - This window of time wasn't very exciting and I was in mist of a lot of self-doubt and going second and multiple thoughts to as to what to do full-time! This question kept oscillating and was hitting both ends of the swing. Introspection seemed to help at this time and I was already in another internship role related to my previous work which I took up as the organization's technology seemed interesting and the pay was also fairly good. Into the role, I did a lot of testing, system configuration and validation which over time plateaued out my interest and once I realized about the company's plan was a bit crude and me sticking there didn't seem much exiting and was having not a lot to add value to(i somehow started to excuse myself from taking lead in things) and was paralelly exploring a lot of opportunities online. University placements wasn't going good at all and I had to sit on my own boat  at this point
  - At this point, I had touched upon a plethora of topics in my domain and wasn't too sharp in any. So I  had to bet on my gut feeling and trying to forsee myself 2, 3, 5 years down the line. Every day was new and I was hitting across not so interesting and interesting by a role with a low-ball payscale. So doing software development didn't stick to me very well and I felt that I was attempting to do it for the sake of it being popular and lucrative. I enjoy embedded systems with a good co-existence of hardware and software. Any of it alone felt a bit monotonous to do over-time and didn't seem to have a growing value addition in the industry. Down the line today, I am thinking to take up a role related to Electronic design for RF mmWave devices. Why this? I just felt this is an unexplored field for me and an advanced version of all of what I have been doing all this time. I am looking to work on hardware development, FPGAs and a tonne of math to learn if so required(usually avoiding - my bad). One thing that I thought is the company is definitely doing a serious technical development with a blend of extremely experienced and new people evident atleast from my back of the envelope stalking and the set of people who interviewed me thinks that I can possibly do that and work on these technologies. That gave a good dopamine secretion and I opted to take up the opportunity. There is something of a match one feels with the company and if it is  mutual from the other side too, then I feel there is no better fit. Sometimes its like - whatever you know come on in! and sometimes it seems that the company doesn't want you to get in. A good tradeoff between these two is a click! Onwards and upwards I am still looking forward to see how things align and what comes up next....

### Rocket boys 1,2 binge watch... a lot of essences?
<p><i>01st May 2023</i></p>

<p> We always see people who are successful mostly come from reputed education, employment background. But what makes it so is probably the environment they're bound to, seeing people around doing something out of mediocrity and the legacy continues. All it takes is dare to imagine things an start it - reference to Homi, Sarabhai and background of IISc, Cambridge.</p>

<p>If something is envisoned and needs to get started, it is seen that the person doesn't care about resources, money, funds or all of that. They're catalysts ofcourse, but souldn't stop from getting the needle moved - reference to the inception of nuclear, space program.</p>

<p> Sometimes you'e to be extremely controversial, go against all of it, and afterall the sign of greatness is being convoluted. Despite of all the headwids, fear of losing reputation, death a choice has to be made to be the self chosen - reference to Homi's strong talks with american authorities.</p>

<p>One common thing seen is that the creator of the technology is bound to keep things secret, be selfish for making money, pride, hold reputation and all of that. It is very much seen that america being the creator of a lot of technological advances, holds that pride and at the same time tries to protect its intellectual whatever the effect may be and tries to hold up in the competition by War, murder or anything. This is seen in daily life too and is a nature of us. But in midst, shouldn't mercy, empathy, kindness come in atleast to a small extent? I feel so strongly. Reference to Shastri's, Homi's death and continuous monitoring of india's nuclear program by CIA.</p>

<p>There can be a bug within your system flying unnoticed. Its often necessary to be open to listen to a diverse set of things, acknowledge everything and make own judgement.</p>

### Share? Be silent? Achievements
<p><i>10th April 2023</i></p>

<p>There are different types of people coming to achievements and sharing about it. Someone may be  silent passive and filthy rich and someone may be in the process of becoming so and actibely sharing about their steps. And some others feel like they've done everything enough and are just being a social media streak sharing all necessary unnecessary things. It's interesting to see when someone shares about things like "roadmap", "10 ways to get xxxx" etc but I personally believe its unique for everyone and shouldn't just over follow someone or get too much motivated. We sometimes get stuck in that content consumpton loop and do nothing about it. But there are some generic things which people share to be aware of while one wants to go a long way ahead beacuse some things are usually certain which many don't realize or know! This is one interesting share: https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful </p>

### Spectrum race
<p><i>18th March 2023</i></p>

<p>That cool green campus, calmness from all city chaos - who wouldn't want to rool the wheels and bike around the campus? Likewise was this race organized by IISc cycling club. First of its kind for me who started cycling some 6 months ago and had never participated in race although did some 100km rides. It's gets its own vibes - competition, some adrenaline rush and that fear within. t rained off season previous night and the race was quite scary. I witnessed maximum anount of crashes ever including a scooter guy who hit his brakes immediately and spinned off after noticing bunch of us passing through in a turn.</p>
<p>Some things you realize after exposing yourself to it. I had no clue about racing, strategy and communication with teammates. It was extremenly exciting starting off and first lap was a slow one to understand the track and teammates. Couple of champions joined the race - Aditya, Atharv and it was amazing looking at their endurance and power. Ended up 4th in this race averaging at around 24.4kmph speed for over 30kms. I certainly look forward to participate in more of these races although off-road MTB trails excite me more.</p>

### All the way home!
<p><i>8th March 2023</i></p>

<p>Yesterday was fear,...yes literally. When you're attached to something and it's on danger, the gut won't stay silent. Somehow randomly decided to take my cycle Edge ET-3 to home by bus. All was good until the bus conductor showed up at the pickup point and said No space for your bike! Me in the middle of the road at Yeahvanthpur junction stranded - but after some convincing and showing cool quick release of front weel feature, it was put on top of the bus. I was literally hearing the cycle bumping and no sleep inside :| Inner peace destroyed and at the next pitstop, I decide to cimb upto the top and tie it with couple of more ropes. All set, Manglaluru at 545am and ready to rock to home ;)</p>
<p>It was fun overall although had to book an expensive bus with large carriage space while way back. Some things are realizied after trying and turns out this one was quite out of craze.</p>

### Confusing decisions - Y/N/Maybe
<p><i>2nd February 2023</i></p>

<p>Got a new cycle couple of days ago. UT EDGE ET3 and its a nice one. The decision making part almost kills. Is it worth getting one? Am I legible to afford that? Is there any defects in this pre-owned cycle? All these doubts come up and easy decsion by the mind is 'Maybe'. Just like people say 'It depends' in tech meetings. How to take right decision at this point? Mind tries to put itself in comfort always by mostly saying 'No' for risky/out of normal decisions. But is it really correct? Someone said risk-reward is a combo. Ah! total confusion now and I am biased.</p>
<p>Flip side, I made the deal and turns out it's totally worth it now. Need to wait and see for more....</p>

### As much friction as it seems - no, not!
<p><i>26th January 2023</i></p>

<p>Signed up for the Republic Day health awareness ride in the campus. Extreme friction to start for it - was told to assemble by 630am infront of IISc main building and me trying to go live for the day at 545am with alarm screaming and sitting in the bed thinking what next....go or not...FOMO! It was all till jumping out of the bed and post quick referesh, stiting on the saddle. The excitement grows then to see what's up and meet some new people through the ride. Was a fun one to say - never thought something like this could be  organized and 40+ people appeared. Tasted something which felt like beetroot milkshake after the ride and met Harish once again. </p>

<p>Somehow I like reading biographies and staring at documentaries. Watched 'Trust No One(2022)' the other day - story of crypto exchange in Canada and what turned out! Now into the book written by his wife post his death starting to realize what had happened. So far a nice one telling what was up with her uptil mid 20s and damn, the culture is so different - so much so on the flip side of what I am into,...haha. Not excited about such one though - too much of unnecessary risks and headaches before trying to know self. By the way, the book is 'Bitcoin Widow'</p>

### Kickstarting the Game
<p><i>19th January 2023</i></p>

<p>Over last coupe of weeks, I got to meet some super enthusiastic cyclists. All they are is consistent and everyone started from ground zero. Was part of Sagar - an Ironman trilaton India finisher's troop in a weekly event organized by Cult. One good tip I got is: Work incrementally, equip yourself incrimentally depending on the taste you like. Mountain biking? Road biking? Both? getting gears to help in efficient rides etc... All neeeded is just to start, keep sticking to the personal motive and upgrading he says.</p>

### The Reputation Game
<p><i>17th January 2023</i></p>

<p>People suddenly start to pay attention when a brand name is attached to someone or a product. This is happening to be a typical tendency of us - sleepwalking with things and not actually evaluating. But above all in first palce, its not easy or free to get attached with a brand name and the effort goes in getting there. Involvement of nepotism is pure crap here, but that's not very common. For example: IITian getting into a great company(not by payscale I say, but by the business and product they do) who do not have any knowledge on the domain even though there are plentiful lower tier university people scattered. A product incubated at IISc or some DST funded lab stepping into market smoothly whereas other super impactul innovations going fail... we have seen many of these around. It all comes down to work put at some point of time in life - be it to about hard work and tireless practice at 17year age to get into good university or a good research and patent with an organizations or simply who you have decide to have a coffee with! Nothing comes free, easy or out of blues - if so, there is a certain struggle right ahead.</p>

### A Nice Read 
<p><i>15th December 2022</i></p>

<p>What a great read! Build by Tony Fadell. One thing which I can resonate with is good and bad a-holes at workplace or studyplace. Some people can be very good infront of you, with  you and flip the bit as soon as you're out. Totally out of co-ordiation and as if 'never mind' then. A nice blog is here on this - https://9to5mac.com/2022/05/03/tony-fadell-book-build/ </p>

<p><i>5th November 2022</i></p>

<p>This is the second movie I am writing about here. "The Intern" - amazing movie with lessons in each scene. Push the boundaries. Be up for any type of  work. Move ahead of expectations. Know about people with you - be at work or a trip or amywhere. Show kindness, behave gentle and be consistent in actions. Take situational opportunities, may seem wrong - but if it gives an opportunity to explore or understand soemthing, its certainly right.</p>

-----

<p><i>1st November 2022</i></p>

<p>Amazing day with unexpected incidents. Was casually riding in a cycle(probably little too fast) and slightly hit a scooter which was turning around in middle of the road. No any hard impacts or injury - but the scooter driver yelled at me. Me thinking its a minor hit to edge of the mudguard just kept moving also because there were vehicles behind in a narrow road and I cringed to stop at that moment somehow.... fast forward, I crossed the traffic signal and a guy is pulling my shirt asking to stop!!! As I stopped the cycle and turned around, there come a bang! bang! and again. I was hit by 2 boys right on my face and lips started bleeding.  Well, I totally apologized and after seeing my lips, he offered me a juice in nearby shop and let go. I may not have damaged the scooter - even a minor scratch, but the person's ego as he yelled at me and I was just moving - my bad :( </p>

<p>Its easy to make mistake, an error, an accident or anything wrong. The consequence is that you may hurt yourself, someone in the front physically or mentally. One thing I understood is that at any of these instances, drop your ego, respect and just come down, pause for a moment, apologize, understand the cause and how to avoid it before moving on. This may take the situation a long way better.</p>

<p><i>30th August 2022</i></p>

<p>Did a dumb job? Things didn't work as it has to? Hung up in a totally irrelevant situation? and many more happenes every day.... One thing that can help out here is to hold yourself straight up - be confident to justify what your're doing and what has happened - apologise as we take wrong turns many turns - let not anyone judge you or don't mind if that happens. Speaking up about it confidently brought myself out of these situations and helped fix it many times. But yes, its not easy to speak up or justify all the time. Get into many such situations, realize you're in it(never sleepwalk with situations) self enhance and over time its all ok! </p>

<p>Had this situation today - sometimes you may not get what you are supposed to get and you're disappointed. Logically you're supposed to have it(and others who are in your place have it). These always keep happening and me an introvert try to find excuses myself and keep shut most of the times. I mostly never quarreled or encountered such situation in high and just got silent thinking its all fine! Maybe sometime its the best solution - like you can't go and argue always, but softly doing it, telling your issue and justfifcation with your stance is really necessary I feel now. So once I did this softly and it didn't work out immediately. Eventually maybe multipe people raised similar arguements, but it worked out today and I am getting what I need. I can understand it is not from my speakup alone, but a collective voice and the management has taken this decision. So you may never know what's happening in the backend - just raise the voice if you think you're not given equality/importance or whatsoever you think is supposed to and leave rest for the environment to work out!</p>

-----
<p><i>28th August 2022</i></p>

<p>Think for a moment before you talk or approach a problem. Getting into and thinking may be inefficient or unnecessary things may slip in. Some people may be good at both, but I just run into a feedback loop "Damn! I am stuck and what will people think if I don't answer/approach this rightly and mind stalls"....</p>

<p>Take pauses while speaking to think if you're going ok! Go to other person's stand and view what you have just said. If you don't know - its ok to take a pause again, think and tackle the situation. Don't overthink what may be going on other people's mind and how bad/good they may be thinking about you.</p>

<p>Sometimes people may think you're crazy if you're too confident or too nervous or too fast in speaking. Do not exaggerate or include unreal stuff in the conversation just to make it seem more sugary. It is easy to catch up and reveal for a trained person. If it slips in speed of the moment, just take it back and correct yourself immediately.</p>

<p>Give attentaion to minor details. I cannot do this enough.... Apparently it turns out how well you know a thing is by how basically you can tell about that. Its not easy, but if made an habit - a lot of sleepwalking is avoided. Don't stop at it when the purpose is achieved if there's still more detail to look for.</p>

<p>If you know that you should not do something, yet you're dragged there by mind or by situation - make that thing hard to find or difficult to do. Shouldn't open an app frequently? Uninstall it or move it out of home screen(yes, these days there's app for each thing and everything)</p>

-----
<p><i>10th July 2022</i></p>

<p>Some good learnings and mixed experiences working and with life. Keys:</p>
<p>Look at the mind hungry tasks to work. Everyone can do sleepwalking tasks.</p>
<p>Act on things. Be it wrong or you don't have clue how to do it. Start  it and there's always people who can help the one who starts and shows interest + effort.</p>
<p>If something is not assigned to you which you think should have, someone just thought you're not capable or legible. Just not mind too much and work on  improving at it so that you can changge that view, improve and take up next time. Everything is for a reason and there's always people who are more experienced around you.</p>
<p>This thing I lack a lot - Hop on and talk to people. Build relationships and stay active on conversation ocassionally. This takes things way farther, more than you can ever imagine and in an organization, it opens up so much possibilities for your growth and holstic goodness. So next time, jum onto a conversation and speak up.</p>
<p>No one cares if you don't speak up. Put out your feelings, share and communicate. You can put hours of effort to work and try to learn new things and stay shut or conversate  with people, tell what you're doing, ask ideas and suggestions, feel holistic and learn. This somewhat makes others feel that your'e not just dumb and actually alive doing something.</p>
<p>Take some time out to spare out of doing mainstream work, do some other sidetask and then jump back. This one I think work good for me. Given one work, I can keep on it whole day doing something - but if I do something else pairing with a task, I get a sense of productiveness and efficiency as I switch once I am bore with one or stuck somewhere.</p>
<p>While stuck on something or don't know what to do, hold on and scatterfocus out of it. Take  a pen-paper and write down your steps to realize what you're thinking and doing. Once with me it was so dumb that I was trying to get a feature working building from scratch eventually unfuncional just to realize that the same feature is alreaby built-in and sample code is given in documentation which I have already read sleepwalking through and was just infromt of my eyes. So scatterfocus and just calm down for a while s you can spread attention around spheres.</p>

-----

<p><i>1st July 2022</i></p>

<p>When someone asks you something, its not because theyr'e dumb or jobless or need you - its just that they want to know something from you and couragesour enough to ask up! Think of it for a while and answer appropriately. Likewise when you have something in mind, just ask up....most underrated thng ever. Ask , ask for help, for excuse or for a chance. Who knows what turns out!!! If not immediately, they'll remember you for future chances.</p>

-----

<p><i>7th June 2022</i></p>

<p>You simply can't reject something with no reason. Justification is important and this provides a sens eof assurance and trust for both the parties. If something is in your mind, put it out.</p>

-----

<p><i>6th June 2022</i></p>

<p>Got to meet some cool people at the company. You can't judge someone or something from a look. Sometimes people can be very friendly and sometimees not. If not, that doesn't specifically mean they're closed - but its just not the right time. Or try again.</p>

<p><i>5th June 2022</i></p>

<p>Day before entering to a real job - like corporate for me. Hold not too much expectations anytime.</p>

-----

<p><i>30th May 2022</i></p>

<p>I have a huge confusion in making this judgement - Is it ok to go unfair/against rules/cheat in a situation when you're not able to move in a legitemate path towards the result? I see many around me who are in my same page doing it. But should I? Is it unfair me not doing it?</p>

<p>I fell better when I share my trouble/pain to someone and listenting whatever they say. Many times people tend to normalize me down even it was my fault that caused pain. Keeping it in makes me think more about it, and think that I am thinking more about it - running into a feedback loop of pain in mind.<p>

-----
<p><i>26th May 2022</i></p>

<p>Watched 'Blinded By The Light'. Absolutely great movie. What an art - pleasing, silent, smooth and very touching (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_by_the_Light) and lots to learn. If you know youre doing right, take accountability, risk upon and just keep moving. Consistency is important, never mind what others think of you, your work or whatsoever. Aim, work, keep on it, present it to the commons and rest will be seen.</p>

-----

<p><i>17th May 2022</i></p>

<p> Quick fixes are common all aroud. Focusing on a short term, quick bucks plan is common all around. Its nothing to be a problem, but its just not scalable or compunding most of the time. While thinking of long term and planning something, people hardly trust themsleves and and no one aroud cases as there is no fruit. One who stays in this ballpark for a while, generates and builds self trust and keeps straight on it is likey to reap compounded benefits after a while. At this time, the same people around will think that the bro is lucky and got into a overnight success.... Having self trust and belief in what youre planning and doing is seemingly the key and keep on it, just keep on it.</p>

<p>Its common to see someone judge you based on one occurence sometime and even though you're not that now, you've left that impression on other side. What to do? The best I do is ignore to be on that side and if things come closeby, I just tell them -- that's not how it is now and have come long way away.</p>

<p>Some people are irritating. Moreover there's a correction -- you're irritating to them likely. Or you're so ill minded to think its irritating. Its all on what you think and how you semm to be. Ok, coming back -- if someone is irritating, see why is it. Some people just keep complaining, keep asking  you for help which is 'googleable', keep bothering you with silly reasons and what not! Think why? Ask why? Act on it than staying silent.</p>

<p>Complaining is not the solution. Morons keep doing it,....but see, try to find why is it? Give a second to think of solution, roadmap or what pointers could be brrought to bypass it, slash over it or convince and workaround to bring up a solution. As famously told "Stich in time saves nine".</p>

<p>If you're into something and feel its dry -- be it a online meeting, chat with friends, a planning or sort, then it is definitely dry for you. Try to add value to it if you think so and the critical thing is to follow up. Follow up after talks, after action point discussion, after reading, after project planning or after just a casual chat. This will get things reinforced just like you need to cure the concrete after poring it to build buildings to stay rough and tough.</p>

<p>Environment influences us a lot! A lot infact. What's the difference between being at IIT and say a tier 3 university? Its the people, peers, network. The elite ones are putting efforts in somthing or the other. Doesn't matter where, in what area - but working hard is super important. This gives a sense of competition, awareness in general and keeps someone on track.</p>

<p><i>15th May 2022</i></p>

<p>Its been quite sometime now since I wrote here. Around 3 weeks, I was nowhere ON. Was into learing embedded systems, BMS stuff and semester exams coming up. Not busy, but this was just out of priority. Wasn't getting that spark to write something here and I was trying to slip myself off from this to avoid procrastinating that I haven't written anything here. Trying to get a hang of it as a habit, but not forcefully. But now -- here we go,....</p>

<p>Sometimes I get this burst of interest or thirst for doing something. One of them is reading about peoples thoughts, experiences, writing down information. This may be after I watch a YouTube video(like today I saw children's science fair event -- aboslutely staggered to see what they are doing), a movie rarely or a book!  It makes me pause, think what's going on, what I can do and so on,....</p>

-----

<p>Bro! Why are there so many content creators out there :: Its absolutely staggering to see people making podcasts, interviews and all spend good old time watching it and doing nothing(majority). Who is building products? Who is bringing services? I am sure one who does and have plans doesn't really watch a lot of these. Its like a ferrari story -- they don't adverise as people who can afford it aren't infornt of TV all the time! It just feels good to watch these and comment as 'Inspirational'. The one who creates content makes some quick bucks with no brainy thing going around. Just get something, synthesize and broadcast - a labour job.</p>

-----

<p><i>14th May 2022</i></p>

<p>Came across a LinkedIn post and someone was saying that Indian software engineers and vast spread and prime movers in US industry bit there is 0 Indian software procuct(as of now). Why? Its really thinkstriking! A large part of comment section conplained that education  system is wrecked(good old joke) and one comment which nearly made sense is that we people look at 'low hanging fruit' meaing a quick short term plan/idea to be happy(mostly to earn). It maybe because of mindset from past, our environment and culture. We are strictly and throughly made to have a hierarchy in a system. Respect older people(ofcourse do), don't go against them, don't give counter talks to them, follow what they day and so on. We like to be ruled. Ancestoral mentality was same, we were ruled by Britishher's for a long time and now still feel good to be in that mindset(a large herd of us). Makes sense, but what can we do? Its definitely changing.</p>

-----

<p><i>22nd April 2022</i></p>

<p>I can 100% trust the person who tells about or shows own mistake, suffering and gives pointers to improve. 99% of things we see daily are just good moments of one's day or just portraited as good moment of one's day. Social media is the ++ among them. Just a few dope shots, a few more, ah,...come on, only a few more.</p>

-----

<p><i>21st April 2022</i></p>

<p>I do not defend when I know I am wrong. It may be a bit of compromise to my ego, but I don't want to be dumb to everyone around but me thinking I have sucessfully hidden the mistake.</p>
<p>Use sorry if its just about feelings, use sorry and tell why and how it happened if something has caused because of it, use that Aha! and convey how you could avoid it in future, improve and fix the current mistake if someone tries to point it out and guides.</p>
<p>Sometimes I make mistakes without realizing it. What then?</p>

-----

<p><i>20th April 2022</i></p>

<p>If you know you want to do or you don't want to do surely, hold on it being unbiased to what's going on around. But was that judgement mature enough?</p>

-----

<p><i>18th April 2022</i></p>

<p>You can get the authority. You can be at that position. You can hold that responsibility. Its all on how you utilize it, how well you spread ideas, knowledge, thoughts to people around with that power.</p>
<p>You can be a teacher and just teach, test, evaluate and go on. Or you can also do that process optimally by engaging with, having some activities, passively evaluating and making sure it reached out well and many more.</p>

-----

<p><i>17th April 2022</i></p>

<p>If you are thinking about something and getting no idea on what, how, yes/no -- just speak up. There are always people around you and you'll get insights/answers. Never mind what they think, beacuse no one thinks that you have asked it after you ask as much as you...</p>

<p><i>13th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Thanks Naval! Here is my message to:</p>
<p><b>10 year old self:</b> Dude, seriously? Don't care or listen to anything specific. Like this suggestion or sort of shits. Let the organs grow. Stay natural and don't try to manipulate anything(especially WhiteHat Jr coding). You're all set back then.</p>  

<p><b>15 year old self:</b> Try to come out of 'I am still young to do things of my own -- will do it later' bubble. Talk a lot, talk to diverse set of people. Explore everything and don't stick to a thing thinking I am doing this for all my life seeing only a cricket match or football over TV. Everyone want's be famous, rich and that's why celebraties fall into our eyes first. Think of struggles, read books, a lot of them and learn about people, what made them to be the person you admire at! Things are not going to be easy neither that hard for next set of years.</p>  

<p><b>20 year old self:</b> Just 20.6 now. Have learnt quite a bit in this couple of years. Try to do things your own way and never mind about whats around. But also have a sense of what's going on. This phase in life is of intense learning -- be it education, about people or life(much more to come). So start learning whatever turns you ON. Be it anything from History to Finance to Science to Engineeering. Seems like things are flipping a lot. Everyone needs to know a bit of everyting and its all running interdisciplinary. Multitask, stay tuned to something streamlined and have a specification tag. You see people younger and of your age winning the world -- try to learn from them, stay tuned to what's trending and mainly and majorly "don't sleepwalk with desires" and making of decisions.</p>  

-----

<p><i>13th April 2022</i></p>

<p>When you move at your own direction -- probably out of herd, things around start seeming strange. Everything seems over beurocratic, unnecessary tiresomes, mundane stuffs and a lot more as things can't change easily as you have changed. This kills. Try to covery your idea or why do you think so to bring change in the things around. Else it will stay generic, forever generic.</p>

-----

<p><i>12th April 2022</i></p>

<p>People around you won't like you going out of herd. You can go alone if you want and once you start to do so, just leave back the herd's mentality. Not always you'll find this good. Herd helps a lot at times else you need to work super hard for making things done.</p>

-----

<p><i>11th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Some days are chill, some are hard, some are suprising. But today was so much inspiring listening to Kumar. Lots to learn from you 🙏. Lots to learn from people arond us -- we just don't get to know unless we stay super kind and heartly. </p>

<p><i>10th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Got into a situation of blindly saying 'yes' and then never turned up for it. Also happened couple of times before. Why did I sleepwalk with that answer? That's again a sleepwalk. Ugh,...I am just trying to sort out myself.</p>

-----

<p><i>6th April 2022</i></p>

<p>If someone is curious about you, your work or sort of it,..you seriously shouldn't neglect the situation or leave it in a smile. Just ask about their thirst, try to share what you can. Think of it -- would you approach someone or ask soemthing just for no reason or for fun? Likely not. So you too give counter curiosity and consider it.</p>

-----

<p><i>5th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Not expressing opinions thinking you're small, indominant to the other is not right I think. Just say what you need, what you think, what you do and it really boils down things a lot. And above all, don't try to simplify things to make it sound cool or 'not so rigid'. It will likely be misunderstood on the other side.</p>

-----

<p><i>4th April 2022</i></p>

<p>Trying to control a feeling sucks. That entity you're trying to control compounds over and over and makes you think more about it when you're controlling. Just express it and let whatsoever turn out! Anyways worthier than keeping it in :| </p>

<p><i>30th March 2022</i></p>

<p>If you do not know what to say, just say you do not... These's an option. Why utter something cluttered looking confused and try to patch up things. And if you don't know what to do, pause, ask for suggestions, relate it, apply and proceed. (you is I and I need to learn it by applying it in situations)</p>

-----

<p><i>28th March 2022</i></p>
<p>Given words can't be taken back. We tend to make further statements to counter previously made ones. Don't promise when you're confused, suprised or encountered an unexpected situation. Hold on, give it a second, think about it and approach to a decision. Taking a suggestion from someone in midst will really help.</p>

More than having a large network, its important to stay in touch, updated with with great people and ones who have helped you, trusted you at some point of time. I feel its easy to get connections, but hard to maintain and stay in sync with for a long time. Need to be very thoughtful about it. This is real.</p>

<p>How to control saturation? Came across someting interesting, looked over it, kindof understood and that then connected to chain of contents finally making me feel that I do not remember where it all started and why am I even doing it!</p>
<p>Pause, get extracts, rethink, note down(most under-rated) and maybe schedule some of it for future. Content is easy to consume -- we often tend to sleepwalk with many of these activities in a generic flow which world/crowd/surroundings follows. Isn't that sick?</p>

<p>With Great Responsibility, Comes Great Power(inverse of what uncle ben told) holds true? Getting the accountability on ourselves is (not)hard, as self tries to stay away from it. We want to sit, relax warm in a nice soft couch -- but getting up and taking a run around streets can open up some unexpected possibilities which might turn out to be good.</p>

<p> Choices: Is it good to do a work half an hour each day forever consistently or start with 2 hours a day thinking about continuing forever, but eventually leading to a burnout. Excitement is real while kickstarting. How to hold on with that and eventually harness that excitement for consistently yielding the result? </p>

<p>Tracking is a next level skill and everyone should try it. Tracking everything from tasks, decisions we make to money will bring a sense to things we make and seepage of time, effort and money can be captured. 50% + of times, we tend to sleepwalk with these things as habits and tracking can bring most of them to context. It can simply start from installing a Digital Wellbeing plug-in to android phone to see how many notifications have poked you that day and how many times you've unlocked, app usage stats etc. These stats are seemingly suprising every time I look at!</p>

<p> No harm in jumping into conversations randomly with strangers. Get to know, tell about you, bring that loop into the conversation and try to drop a hook. By 'hook' I mean anything -- be it for an opportunity you're looking for. Be it for getting your content out for publicity, or maybe a simple praise and thanks for conversating.</p>
<p> > Saw some students who got to the bus at the same stop with me and turns out they're freshers and I got to share a Electronics Club enrollment form!</p>
<p> > Just told the conductor of the new electric-bus that it is supercool and very comfortable to travel. He got super happy!</p>
<p> > Went to a shopkeeper asking for 500rs cash in exchange to online payment to 500rs. Turns out he disagreed and demanded 525rs for 500rs cash. Got nothing to excite the randon shopkeeper. Could have nudged something though,....Not everytime it works!</p>

<p>Networking, Influence takes the matter to next level. But how to get it? Speak, Praise, Talk in terms of the benefit of other side.</p>

<p>Doing and repeating what is already done isn't dumb at all! It can still be scalable and the feel in making it your way is charming.... </p>
<p>Mr.Analog would have done it in a very better way, but only he knows his real journey and the steering pointers he had taken. Doing at your side gives your side of experience and kick!</p>

<p>Synthesizing is important. We have everything we (dont)need at the easiest reach and the tool which helps in synthesizing things is a pro. Between, you can also be your own synthesizer!</p>

<p>Content! And more content! With internet being up for 20+ years and counting, it isn't hard to find the required content. But getting required content is quite hard. Finding is not getting and because its easy to find something, but a lot of distractions, issues, constraints come up on the way of getting it into your arsenal.</p>

<p><i>28th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Got an idea? Excited? Hold on a while, think in other dimensions, from someone else's standpoint etc., before springing up and executing it. This really helps make things fault tolerant and provides long shelf-life to the idea.</p>

<p><i>27th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Someone told -- to get people come your way, you should genuinely fall in interest with what they do. Might work, but at the same time I feel this has to be done not with the goal of getting people your way. Else that genuinity doesn't exist! So you can't give dumb advice like this to the people.</p>

<p><i>26th January 2022</i></p>

<p>We're good at doing similar or cyclic task altogether at once. Be it scheduling a time in a day to send out all emails or to reply to WhatsApp messages. But the urge, curiosity and mainly the fact that it would eventually get forgotten kills....</p>

-----

<p><i>25th January 2022</i></p>

<p>E-Learning is good as everything lies at our fingertips. But isn't that killing the curiosity and patience to some extent? There's nothing to crave for and if you think you want to do, you do!</p>

<p>If you knew the box, which you have to open, just go for it and start to scratch the surface. No matter how large the key!</p>
<p>This is it -- if you want to go and you don't see the path, still keep going, even if you unfortunately don't know the destination. The fact that you want to go should drive it all! Turns out the effort is worth it even if you hit the wrong destination because you don't know what the destination is!!!</p>

<p>What I ideally thought: If you are into something important, stay on track, keep yourself on it hard, let whatever happens in world...</p>
<p>What I again thought I should be doing: Yes, keep yourself hard on the task, but at the same time stay compatible with the world and be in syc with events around. This helps and a lot in all fronts. Afterall we are here in the world, for thw world and highly influenced by the own surroundings.</p>

<p>Pause, think and act when you're rude. Decisions made at that instant is irreversible as both the parties will be at high-ego. Or dare to bring down your ego and correct the situation later on! If none, situation will end up like IND-PAK.</p>

<p><i>17th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Do that thing which you think you can't do!<p>
<p>Sounds like a high level philosophical thought, isn't it? But the way out is to do little by little and trying to be a part of it by making it as a habit. It might be as simple as signing up over email for a volunteering position to a NGO or agreeing to present 4 webinars and rest will gradually follow up in nature's sequence.</p>

<p><i>16th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Isn't doing the work consistently for a longer span of time better than finshing it up at a really quick pace too early or very lately?</p>
<p>Its told that by doing something for a span of 21 days consistently, you can master anything! or someone told it 20 hrs in a TED talk.</p>

<p>You won't get thoughts unless you interact with people or by simply being outside.</p>

<p>Write something when you feel like writing or else you'll end up writing things like this ;)</p>

<p>Comfort depends on mentality. If you think you're comfortable, then you are!.</p>

<p><i>12th January 2022</i></p>

<p>Jump into the pit and try for the way out. No worries if not suceeded instantly. Can always rest, sleep and retry. The decision to jump into it is of utmost power. Give counter thoughts to the negative thoughts which come meanwhile and its OK to self exaggerate the thoughts.</p>
<p>Try things in your own way and be the earliest one to put out issue if hit or in sharing the results. Earliest one is earliest one and rest will follow.</p>

<p>First time tring to pack the day fully scheduled with distributed activities. Truns out it works good for one half, but there's still underflow and uneaten task pending. Another thing is that when hard timeline and separation is put between tasks, natural tendency is - getting compromised with the work whatsoever is completed and trying to catch up with the schedule. This might not involve verifying, proofing etc., in rush.</p>
<p>Still writing this in regret of not coping up with the evening's work(11:10pm now,.....awww) Cheers!!!</p>

<p>Stay calm,...stay as fool. Even if the person infront is yelling at you. This makes them feel they're really going strange at you and eventually freeze themselves. Adding from other side will only increase the intensity as no one's ready to give up their ego in anger. </p>

<p><i>9th January 2022</i></p>

<p>If something doesn't turn out to be on your side and want it so badly, don't leave it there. Think of opportunities in it(be it a worst case scenario) and drop some fish hooks. See if someting gets caught back again.</p>
<p>If you think you should ask it or not, just ask it. No harm and it only turns out to be a hookup for some opportunity sooner or later!</p>

<p><i>8th January 2022</i></p>

<p>If someone wants to get your attention and you realize it, just give that damn attention and appretiate the seeker well. Its to utmost feeling for the other side although your mind and ego tries to ignore it. Its mutual and we all need it.</p>
<p>If you want to seek something or so badly ask with someone, just put it straight out as you want it. Our mind tries to cringe and hide, but its all plain on the other person's side and is clueless what's in our mind. Going straight away to it will far better help that going slowly with ten other hints.</p>

<p>I hurry too much to close my browsed tabs before the job gets done........</p>
<p>(Ctrl + Shift + T) turns out to be the ultimate saviour.</p>

<P>Consuming content very good, easy and we have a pile of interesting + exciting content at our disposal mostly for free. But what's next? That now depends on the type of content. Is it entertainment? Get it, laugh, cry or feel it and we never recap it after getting that gratification. Of course, there isn't need too to recap it because that's all that content had to do to us and its over!</p>
<p>There are certain types of content which we consume with a motive to learn or for self-improvement. Since we overwhelmingly consume the earlier type of content, the habit of 'let it go' after consuming it slowly inculcates. Whatever is consumed, try to recap it, take a note of it and physically write it down(the most underrated thing).</p>
<p>We often come across exciting suggestions and promotions. Then we jump on right into it. explore more, explore more about it so much that we end up burning out and this makes us think its all useless or is this really needed? The excitement boils down to self doubt and finally the plan gets dropped. Be it with buying an item online, learning a course, finding people to cold-email for an opportunity or maybe starting to invest in assets. One thing that might help in this is to take the suggestion right down to your mind, think if it it's really helpful for 'you' and then if so, note it down on a calender and make a scheduled plan to execute. This really prevents saturation and takes long way further.</p>

<p>Been 2 months since I touched any EE stuff and my nice mutimeter buttons are eaten by cokroaches in cupboard - hard times won't last long(back to form soon). Not sure if those chips on ESD bag are still crispy with some hopes to get Vcc</p>
<p>Wait and wait and wait,....until some fruitful returns show up. BankBees going up now! Buy some? If you by stocks based on public news, you're not the only one and so that doesn't make much change. But large investors can wake up from nowhere and tune the market. Ufff,....these big giants always have control over and me - a poor kid realizing it after looking at long green candles.</p>

<p>Consistency and long term patience is the key. Be it towards achieving target or investment in stock market. Because it is that you only realize benefit of it when you see a zoomed out version of past in very future, no one tends to care about it.</p>
<p>An opportunity or request comes to you suddenly and if you don't know what to respond, just say OK or YES! Rest always turns out to be good. Our mind may say NO because there is no instant gratification out of it.</p>

-----

<p><i>3rd January 2022</i></p>

<p>Just out of Control Systems exam today. Feedback is important - seek for it at every point, think how i can add value to the people who have trusted, helped and blindly believed.</p>
<p>Learning to remember is shit! Take note of things that can't be remembered and invest in thinking + solving. Start with it even by knowing nothing on it and dare to scratch heads, make no progress but still keep on it.</p>
<p>Remember the past friendly evens and don't hesitate to make someone comfortable even if you get nothing out of it(unless you lose something). But at the same time don't hesitate to say 'no' or lie if it kills your resource.</p>
